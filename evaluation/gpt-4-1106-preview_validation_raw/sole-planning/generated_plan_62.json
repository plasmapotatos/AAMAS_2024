Further adjustments are needed, such as choosing cheaper meal options or removing additional attractions. However, without more options to choose from, it's challenging to fit the plan within the $1,900 budget while meeting all the constraints.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Milwaukee to New York", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3649645, from Milwaukee to New York, Departure Time: 10:50 AM, Arrival Time: 14:22 PM", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Central Park, New York;The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York;", "lunch": "Seasons 52 Fresh Grill, New York", "dinner": "Lord of the Drinks Forum, New York", "accommodation": "Beautiful and big 1BR sublet, New York"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "New York", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Sir John Bakery Cafe, New York", "attraction": "Statue of Liberty, New York;", "lunch": "Garam Masala Food Corner, New York", "dinner": "736 A.D., New York", "accommodation": "Beautiful and big 1BR sublet, New York"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from New York to Milwaukee", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3644990, from New York to Milwaukee, Departure Time: 15:20 PM, Arrival Time: 16:27 PM", "breakfast": "Green Chick Chop, New York", "attraction": "Times Square, New York;The High Line, New York;", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
