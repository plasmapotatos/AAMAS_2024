Additionally, the cost of attractions seems to be significantly high, which suggests that there might be an error in interpreting the provided data. The actual attraction costs should be verified for accuracy.\n\nGiven the constraints and the budget, it is not feasible to include all the listed attractions and dining options within the $4,200 budget. The plan needs to be revised to fit the budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from New Orleans to Miami", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3660109, from New Orleans to Miami, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Bayfront Park, Miami;", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "AB's Absolute Barbecues, Miami", "accommodation": "Charming 1BD Astoria Penthouse, Miami"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Miami", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Clocked, Miami", "attraction": "Jungle Island, Miami;P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, Miami;", "lunch": "Tako Cheena by Pom Pom, Miami", "dinner": "Shorts Burger and Shine, Miami", "accommodation": "Charming 1BD Astoria Penthouse, Miami"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Miami to Tampa", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3670101, from Miami to Tampa, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Papouli's Mediterranean Cafe & Market, Miami", "attraction": "The Florida Aquarium, Tampa;", "lunch": "The Diet Kitchen, Tampa", "dinner": "Kobe Hibachi & Sushi, Tampa", "accommodation": "Spacious 1+ bedroom apt in NYC, Tampa"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Tampa", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Lalit Kathi Rolls Momos, Tampa", "attraction": "Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, Tampa;", "lunch": "Uptown Fresh Beer Cafe, Tampa", "dinner": "Peg Leg Pete's, Tampa", "accommodation": "Spacious 1+ bedroom apt in NYC, Tampa"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Tampa to New Orleans", "transportation": "Flight Number: F4007107, from Tampa to New Orleans, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Gallery Caf\u00e9 - Hyatt Place, Tampa", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
