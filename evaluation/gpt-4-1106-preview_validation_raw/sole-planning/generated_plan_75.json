To adjust the plan to fit within the budget, we need to make some changes:\n\n- **Accommodation**: Since the budget is exceeded, we will need to find a cheaper accommodation option that still allows parties. However, based on the provided accommodation options, there are no cheaper alternatives that allow parties. Therefore, we cannot create a travel plan that includes party-allowed accommodations within the $1,000 budget.\n\nGiven the budget constraint and the requirement for accommodations where parties are allowed, it is not possible to create a feasible travel plan with the provided data. If the accommodation requirement regarding parties can be relaxed, or the budget can be increased, a new plan can be created.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Jacksonville to Washington", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3635008, from Jacksonville to Washington, Departure Time: 16:58, Arrival Time: 18:44", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Los Aztecas, Washington", "accommodation": "Comfortable & Cozy Times Square Apt, Washington"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Washington", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Manna Java World Cafe, Washington", "attraction": "Space Needle, Washington;The Seattle Great Wheel, Washington;Chihuly Garden and Glass, Washington;", "lunch": "Hemingway's Island Grill, Washington", "dinner": "Thaaliwala, Washington", "accommodation": "Comfortable & Cozy Times Square Apt, Washington"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Washington to Jacksonville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3786730, from Washington to Jacksonville, Departure Time: 08:48, Arrival Time: 10:58", "breakfast": "Good Foods, Washington", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
