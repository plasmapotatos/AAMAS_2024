The costs are calculated per person. If the number of travelers is more than one, the costs for meals and accommodations will increase accordingly. The transportation cost for self-driving is considered for the vehicle, not per person. Attractions are chosen based on proximity and interest, and no entry fees are included as they are not specified. The plan does not include lunch and dinner on the first day and dinner on the last day due to travel times. Accommodations are chosen based on the assumption of a single traveler; for more travelers, accommodations will need to be adjusted.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Punta Gorda to Marquette", "transportation": "Self-driving, Duration: 19 hours 48 mins, Distance: 2,198 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "Huge Private Room Near Prospect Park, Marquette"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Marquette", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "The Chop House, Marquette", "attraction": "Presque Isle Park, Marquette;", "lunch": "Taste of Balingup, Marquette", "dinner": "Dovetail, Marquette", "accommodation": "Huge Private Room Near Prospect Park, Marquette"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Marquette to Madison", "transportation": "Self-driving, Duration: 1 hour 17 mins, Distance: 126 km", "breakfast": "Papa Mexicano, Marquette", "attraction": "Madison Children's Museum, Madison;", "lunch": "99 North Restaurant, Madison", "dinner": "Unique Food Hut, Madison", "accommodation": "Oversized bedroom with living space, Madison"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Madison", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Chini Bowl, Madison", "attraction": "Chazen Museum of Art, Madison;", "lunch": "Tibb's Frankie, Madison", "dinner": "Daawat-e!
