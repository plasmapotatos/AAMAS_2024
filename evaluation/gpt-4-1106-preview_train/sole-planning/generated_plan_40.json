The primary cost driver is the taxi transportation. To reduce costs, we can switch to self-driving, which is significantly cheaper. Additionally, we may need to choose more budget-friendly accommodations and dining options. However, due to the complexity of the task and the need to recalculate and revalidate all options, a complete revised travel plan cannot be provided in this format.
