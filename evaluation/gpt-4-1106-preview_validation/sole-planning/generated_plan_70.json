To adjust the plan to fit within the budget, we need to make some changes:\n\n- We can reduce the number of accommodations by booking larger properties that can accommodate more people, thus reducing the total number of units needed.\n- We can choose less expensive restaurants for meals or reduce the number of meals eaten out.\n- We can select fewer attractions or choose free attractions to visit.\n\nPlease note that the provided CSV data does not include options for larger accommodations or less expensive restaurants that would allow us to fit the travel plan within the specified budget. Additionally, the flight costs alone for 8 people exceed the budget when considering a round trip. Therefore, without additional data or the ability to adjust the transportation method, it is not possible to create a travel plan that meets all the requirements within the given budget constraint.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Valparaiso to Belleville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3579167, from Valparaiso to Belleville, Departure Time: 17:23, Arrival Time: 19:06", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Fuji Japanese Steak House, Belleville", "accommodation": "1 Bedroom/1 Bath Apt in Hudson Yards/Midtown West, Belleville"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Belleville", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Super Restaurant, Belleville", "attraction": "Labor & Industrial Museum, Belleville;St. Clair County Historical Society, Belleville;National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows, Belleville;", "lunch": "Ajeet Fast Food Corner, Belleville", "dinner": "Moti Mahal Delux, Belleville", "accommodation": "1 Bedroom/1 Bath Apt in Hudson Yards/Midtown West, Belleville"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Belleville to Valparaiso", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3571908, from Belleville to Valparaiso, Departure Time: 17:15, Arrival Time: 18:55", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
