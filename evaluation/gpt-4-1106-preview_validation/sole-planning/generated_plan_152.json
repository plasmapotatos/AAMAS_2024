Additionally, the accommodation on Day 3 and Day 4 has a minimum night requirement that exceeds the itinerary's stay, but it was chosen due to the lack of other options that fit the budget and party requirement. The group may need to contact the accommodation providers directly to negotiate a shorter stay or find alternative accommodations that allow parties.\n\nThe itinerary assumes that the group will have access to a vehicle that can accommodate 7 people and that the cost of self-driving includes fuel and any other associated costs. The meal costs are based on the average cost per person multiplied by the number of people in the group. Attractions were chosen based on proximity and interest, but no specific times were allocated due to variability in group preferences and potential time constraints.\n\nPlease ensure to double-check all bookings, availability, and current prices as the provided information may have changed since the knowledge cutoff date.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Sun Valley to San Diego", "transportation": "Self-driving from Sun Valley to San Diego, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Open Yard, San Diego", "accommodation": "CHIC EVENT SPACE, San Diego"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "San Diego", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Jetha Lal Ka Dhabha, San Diego", "attraction": "Balboa Park, San Diego;San Diego Zoo, San Diego;USS Midway Museum, San Diego;", "lunch": "The Lost Mughal, San Diego", "dinner": "Gopala, San Diego", "accommodation": "CHIC EVENT SPACE, San Diego"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from San Diego to Oakland", "transportation": "Self-driving from San Diego to Oakland, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Burger King, San Diego", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Cho Gao - Crowne Plaza Abu Dhabi, Oakland", "accommodation": "Harlem Garden Oasis in New York City Brownstone, Oakland"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Oakland", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Malais By Anands, Oakland", "attraction": "Oakland Zoo, Oakland;Chabot Space & Science Center, Oakland;Children's Fairyland, Oakland;", "lunch": "Jammu And Kashmir House, Oakland", "dinner": "Wok On Wheels, Oakland", "accommodation": "Harlem Garden Oasis in New York City Brownstone, Oakland"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Oakland to Sun Valley", "transportation": "Self-driving from Oakland to Sun Valley, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Cafe Coffee Day, Oakland", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
