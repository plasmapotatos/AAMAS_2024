To further adjust, we can opt for a cheaper dinner option on Day 2:\n\nRevised Dinner for Day 2:\nDinner: Shri Ram Restaurant, Atlanta, cost: 55, cuisines: \u201cTea, Mexican, Indian, Fast Food\u201d\n\nRevised Total cost for Day 2 = (22 + 59 + 55) * 3 + 576 = 981\n\nRevised Total cost across all days = 1,011 + 981 + 105 = 2,097\n\nNow the total cost is within the budget of $2,100.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Daytona Beach to Atlanta", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Daytona Beach to Atlanta, Duration: 6 hours 18 mins, Distance: 696 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Ahata, Atlanta", "dinner": "Taste of Vishal, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Bright, Modern, Clean, Spacious, Brooklyn Home, Atlanta"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Atlanta", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Adda, Atlanta", "attraction": "Zoo Atlanta, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Saffron, Atlanta", "dinner": "Asian Bistro, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Bright, Modern, Clean, Spacious, Brooklyn Home, Atlanta"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Atlanta to Daytona Beach", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Atlanta to Daytona Beach, Duration: 6 hours 20 mins, Distance: 706 km", "breakfast": "Beliram Degchiwala, Atlanta", "attraction": "Centennial Olympic Park, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Baba Au Rhum, Atlanta", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
