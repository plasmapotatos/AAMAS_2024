To stay within budget, we can opt for the following changes:\n\n1. Change the accommodation in La Crosse to a more affordable option, such as \"Comfy large room in Wash Heights\" for $457 per night.\n2. Reduce the number of attractions visited to only one per day to save on entrance fees and associated costs.\n3. Choose more budget-friendly dining options, aiming for an average cost of $30 per meal instead of the higher-cost meals initially selected.\n\nWith these adjustments, the new estimated total cost should be closer to the budget of $3,200.
