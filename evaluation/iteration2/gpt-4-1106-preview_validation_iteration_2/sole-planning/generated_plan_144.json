Adjustments are needed to meet the budget constraint. Since the transportation costs are fixed and high due to the choice of taxi, consider changing the accommodation to a more affordable option or reducing meal costs. Additionally, the minimum nights for the accommodation in Marquette do not match the itinerary, and the accommodation in Milwaukee does not allow children under 10, which does not meet the query requirements.
