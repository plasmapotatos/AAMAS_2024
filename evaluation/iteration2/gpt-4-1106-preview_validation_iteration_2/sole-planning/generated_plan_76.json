To adjust the plan within the budget, we need to change the transportation method from flights to a more economical option. Let's consider the taxi option for transportation:\n\nAdjusted Transportation for Day 1 and Day 3:\nDay 1: Taxi, from Appleton to Charlotte, duration: 14 hours 27 mins, distance: 1,534 km, cost: 1534\nDay 3: Taxi, from Charlotte to Appleton, duration: 14 hours 32 mins, distance: 1,536 km, cost: 1536\n\nAdjusted Total cost for Day 1 and Day 3:\nDay 1: 1534 * 7 = 10,738\nDay 3: 1536 * 7 = 10,752\n\nAdjusted Total cost across all days = 10,738 + 3,517.5 + 10,752 = 25,007.5\n\nThis adjustment also exceeds the budget significantly. Therefore, we need to consider self-driving as the transportation method to stay within the budget:\n\nAdjusted Transportation for Day 1 and Day 3:\nDay 1: Self-driving, from Appleton to Charlotte, duration: 14 hours 27 mins, distance: 1,534 km, cost: 76\nDay 3: Self-driving, from Charlotte to Appleton, duration: 14 hours 32 mins, distance: 1,536 km, cost: 76\n\nAdjusted Total cost for Day 1 and Day 3:\nDay 1: 76 * 7 = 532\nDay 3: 76 * 7 = 532\n\nAdjusted Total cost across all days = 532 + 3,517.5 + 532 = 4,581.5\n\nNow, the total cost is within the budget of $9,500. However, the accommodation chosen does not allow visitors, which is against the house rules specified in the query. We need to select an accommodation that allows visitors:\n\nAdjusted Accommodation:\nElegant Studio Apt in Prospect Heights, Charlotte, cost: 640, maximum occupancy: 5, house rules: No parties, minimum nights: 2\n\nAdjusted Total cost for Accommodation across all days:\nDay 1: 640 * (7/5) = 896\nDay 2: 640 * (7/5) = 896\n\nAdjusted Total cost across all days with new accommodation = 532 + (896 + 3,517.5) + 532 = 5,477.5\n\nThis adjusted plan now fits within the budget and adheres to the house rules. Please note that the cost calculations are based on the provided data and may not reflect actual costs. Additionally, the self-driving option assumes that the group has access to a vehicle that can accommodate all members and their luggage.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Appleton to Charlotte", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Appleton to Charlotte, duration: 14 hours 27 mins, distance: 1,534 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "Olive Tree Cafe, Charlotte", "dinner": "Central Perk 7, Charlotte", "accommodation": "Elegant Studio Apt in Prospect Heights, Charlotte"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Charlotte", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Subway, Charlotte", "attraction": "Freedom Park, Charlotte;Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte;Discovery Place Science, Charlotte;", "lunch": "Cafe Maple Street, Charlotte", "dinner": "Kylin Skybar, Charlotte", "accommodation": "Elegant Studio Apt in Prospect Heights, Charlotte"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Charlotte to Appleton", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Charlotte to Appleton, duration: 14 hours 32 mins, distance: 1,536 km", "breakfast": "Shree Hari Vaishnav Dhaba, Charlotte", "attraction": "NASCAR Hall of Fame, Charlotte;The Mint Museum, Charlotte;Bechtler Museum of Modern Art, Charlotte;", "lunch": "Unplugged Courtyard, Charlotte", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
