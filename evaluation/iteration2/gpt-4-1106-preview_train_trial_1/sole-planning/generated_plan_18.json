However, due to the lack of specific accommodation options in the provided data for larger groups, the example above assumes that either additional identical units are available at the same cost or alternative arrangements have been made to accommodate the group within the budget constraints.\n\nCuisines: The restaurants chosen do not specify if they are suitable for young children, but they offer a variety of cuisines that may be suitable for different tastes.\n\nAccommodations: The chosen accommodation specifies \"No visitors,\" which is suitable for a family with young children, and the \"Entire home/apt\" room type provides privacy and space for the group. However, the maximum occupancy is 2, so additional accommodations or units will be needed.\n\nTransportation: Self-driving has been chosen as the mode of transportation to avoid flights and taxis, which are more costly and may not be as convenient for a group traveling with young children. The cost of self-driving is significantly lower and fits within the budget constraints.\n\nAttractions: Attractions suitable for families with young children, such as the National Aquarium and the Maryland Science Center, have been included in the itinerary.\n\nThe total cost of the travel plan is well within the specified budget of $6,500.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Asheville to Baltimore", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Asheville to Baltimore, Duration: 7 hours 43 mins, Distance: 819 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Los Pablos, Baltimore", "accommodation": "Contemporary Home Away from Home, Baltimore"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Baltimore", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Mr. Dunderbak's Biergarten and Marketplatz, Baltimore", "attraction": "National Aquarium, Baltimore;Maryland Science Center, Baltimore;", "lunch": "The Thai Bowl, Baltimore", "dinner": "Salt, Baltimore", "accommodation": "Contemporary Home Away from Home, Baltimore"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Baltimore to Asheville", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Baltimore to Asheville, Duration: 7 hours 42 mins, Distance: 819 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
