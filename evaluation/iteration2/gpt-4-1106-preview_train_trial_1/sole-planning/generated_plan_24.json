However, due to the lack of provided information on other accommodations, I have used the same accommodation for the first two nights. Additionally, the cost of the accommodation is for one person, so I have only included it once in the total cost as it meets the maximum occupancy requirement for two people. The travel plan stays within the specified budget of $4,700.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Asheville to New York", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3641730, from Asheville to New York, Departure Time: 13:49, Arrival Time: 15:40", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Seasons 52 Fresh Grill, New York", "accommodation": "Versatile private room in Harlem/Hamilton Heights!, New York"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "New York", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Sir John Bakery Cafe, New York", "attraction": "Central Park, New York;Empire State Building, New York;", "lunch": "Gurgaon Hights, New York", "dinner": "Green Chick Chop, New York", "accommodation": "Versatile private room in Harlem/Hamilton Heights!, New York"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from New York to Buffalo", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3641101, from New York to Buffalo, Departure Time: 11:59, Arrival Time: 13:09", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "The Buffalo Zoo, Buffalo;Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens, Buffalo;", "lunch": "Shokitini, Buffalo", "dinner": "Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen, Buffalo", "accommodation": "Cozy Studio in Heart of Ft Greene, Buffalo"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Buffalo", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Punjab Grill, Buffalo", "attraction": "Buffalo Naval Park, Buffalo;Delaware Park, Buffalo;", "lunch": "Pinch Of Spice, Buffalo", "dinner": "Red Mango, Buffalo", "accommodation": "Cozy Studio in Heart of Ft Greene, Buffalo"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Buffalo to Asheville", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Buffalo to Asheville, duration: 10 hours 29 mins, distance: 1,110 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
