However, given the budget and the available data, this accommodation has been chosen for two nights to fit within the constraints. If the minimum nights are a strict requirement, an alternative accommodation would need to be selected, potentially exceeding the budget or compromising on other aspects of the trip.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Las Vegas to Denver", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3562563, from Las Vegas to Denver, Departure Time: 14:36, Arrival Time: 17:35", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "The Fatty Bao - Asian Gastro Bar, Denver", "accommodation": "Harlem cozy nights, Denver"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Denver", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Cafe Diva, Denver", "attraction": "Denver Zoo, Denver;Denver Botanic Gardens, Denver;", "lunch": "Nukkadwala, Denver", "dinner": "Rain Tree Grill, Denver", "accommodation": "Harlem cozy nights, Denver"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Denver to Las Vegas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3563345, from Denver to Las Vegas, Departure Time: 22:25, Arrival Time: 23:36", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
