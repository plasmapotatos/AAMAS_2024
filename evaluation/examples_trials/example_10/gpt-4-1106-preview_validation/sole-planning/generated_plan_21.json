To adjust the plan within the budget, we can consider the following changes:\n\n- Opt for a less expensive accommodation in Fort Myers.\n- Reduce meal costs by choosing more budget-friendly restaurants.\n- Revisit transportation options to find cheaper alternatives if available.\n\nPlease note that the accommodation in Orlando has a minimum stay of 30 nights, which is not suitable for this itinerary. We would need to find an alternative accommodation that allows shorter stays. Similarly, the accommodation in Fort Myers has a 7-night minimum stay, which also needs to be changed to fit the 5-day trip duration.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to stay within budget, the travel plan will require further adjustments. Please provide additional options or increase the budget to proceed with a feasible itinerary.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from St. Louis to Orlando (Florida)", "transportation": "Flight Number: F4003646, from St. Louis to Orlando (Florida), Departure Time: 07:31, Arrival Time: 10:43", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Fuji Japanese Steakhouse, Orlando (Florida)", "accommodation": "Sixth Ave Chelsea, Studio Serviced Apartment, Orlando (Florida)"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Orlando (Florida)", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Turquoise Villa, Orlando (Florida)", "attraction": "SeaWorld Orlando, Orlando (Florida); The Wheel at ICON Park, Orlando (Florida)", "lunch": "The Tandoori Times, Orlando (Florida)", "dinner": "Crust N Cakes, Orlando (Florida)", "accommodation": "Sixth Ave Chelsea, Studio Serviced Apartment, Orlando (Florida)"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Orlando (Florida) to Fort Myers (Florida)", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3564762, from Orlando (Florida) to Fort Myers (Florida), Departure Time: 12:45, Arrival Time: 13:35", "breakfast": "Indochi Cafe & Restaurant, Orlando (Florida)", "attraction": "Edison & Ford Winter Estates, Fort Myers (Florida); River District, Fort Myers (Florida)", "lunch": "The Refinery, Fort Myers (Florida)", "dinner": "Al Mukhtar Bakery, Fort Myers (Florida)", "accommodation": "Quiet and beautiful apartment near central park, Fort Myers (Florida)"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Fort Myers (Florida)", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Haunted, Fort Myers (Florida)", "attraction": "Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve, Fort Myers (Florida); IMAG History & Science Center, Fort Myers (Florida)", "lunch": "Maachh Bhaat, Fort Myers (Florida)", "dinner": "Kujay's Spoon, Fort Myers (Florida)", "accommodation": "Quiet and beautiful apartment near central park, Fort Myers (Florida)"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Fort Myers (Florida) to St. Louis", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3951040, from Fort Myers (Florida) to St. Louis, Departure Time: 06:03, Arrival Time: 07:38", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
