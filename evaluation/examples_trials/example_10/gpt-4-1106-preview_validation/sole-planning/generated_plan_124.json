To adjust the plan to fit within the budget, we can consider the following changes:\n\n- Opt for a less expensive accommodation option if available.\n- Reduce meal costs by choosing more budget-friendly restaurants.\n- Consider alternative transportation options, such as a taxi, if it is more cost-effective.\n\nPlease note that the provided accommodation options all have a minimum stay requirement, which may limit flexibility in reducing costs. Additionally, the cost of flights and meals for three people has contributed significantly to the total cost.
