To meet the budget, we would need to consider alternative transportation methods such as self-driving or taking a taxi, which may also exceed the budget due to the long distance. Additionally, we would need to find more affordable accommodations or adjust the itinerary to include fewer attractions and meals out.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Jacksonville to Washington", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3634578, from Jacksonville to Washington, Departure Time: 19:40, Arrival Time: 21:28", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway, Washington"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Washington", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Los Aztecas, Washington", "attraction": "The Seattle Great Wheel, Washington;Space Needle, Washington;", "lunch": "Manna Java World Cafe, Washington", "dinner": "Hemingway's Island Grill, Washington", "accommodation": "Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway, Washington"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Washington to Jacksonville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3786730, from Washington to Jacksonville, Departure Time: 08:48, Arrival Time: 10:58", "breakfast": "Cafe Coffee Day, Washington", "attraction": "Olympic Sculpture Park, Washington;Discovery Park, Washington;", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}, {"day": 1, "current_city": "from Jacksonville to Washington", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3635008, from Jacksonville to Washington, Departure Time: 16:58, Arrival Time: 18:44", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "Stunning 2Bed/2BA + 300sqft deck by the river!, Washington"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Washington", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Los Aztecas, Washington", "attraction": "Space Needle, Washington;The Seattle Great Wheel, Washington;", "lunch": "Manna Java World Cafe, Washington", "dinner": "Hemingway's Island Grill, Washington", "accommodation": "Stunning 2Bed/2BA + 300sqft deck by the river!, Washington"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Washington to Jacksonville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3786730, from Washington to Jacksonville, Departure Time: 08:48, Arrival Time: 10:58", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
