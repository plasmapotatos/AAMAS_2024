To meet the budget, we need to find cheaper accommodation options or reduce the cost of meals and attractions. Since the query specifies that accommodations must allow visitors, we must ensure that the selected accommodations meet this requirement. However, the provided accommodation options either do not allow visitors or exceed the minimum night stay requirement. Therefore, we cannot create a feasible travel plan that meets all the given constraints within the specified budget of $2,400.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Cedar Rapids to Dallas", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Cedar Rapids to Dallas, duration: 12 hours 26 mins, distance: 1,324 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "Take it now you won't find better, Dallas"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Dallas", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Drifters Cafe, Dallas", "attraction": "The Dallas World Aquarium, Dallas;The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Dallas;", "lunch": "Cafe Gatherings, Dallas", "dinner": "Coconuts Fish Cafe, Dallas", "accommodation": "Take it now you won't find better, Dallas"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Dallas to Austin", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Dallas to Austin, duration: 2 hours 53 mins, distance: 314 km", "breakfast": "MONKS, Dallas", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "Entire 2 bedroom top floor in Clinton Hill, Austin"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Austin", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Wildflour Cafe + Bakery, Austin", "attraction": "Texas Capitol, Austin;Zilker Metropolitan Park, Austin;", "lunch": "The Kasbah, Austin", "dinner": "Mehfil-e-Handi, Austin", "accommodation": "Entire 2 bedroom top floor in Clinton Hill, Austin"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Austin to Cedar Rapids", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Austin to Cedar Rapids, duration: 15 hours 5 mins, distance: 1,695 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
