However, the provided accommodations do not offer a single room that fits all 7 people, and the budget does not allow for two entire homes/apt per night. Therefore, the plan assumes that the group is comfortable with splitting into two rooms for the first night, with the second room's cost not included due to insufficient data. The second night's accommodation fits 8 people, so it is suitable for the group.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Salt Lake City to Burbank", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3851481, from Salt Lake City to Burbank, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Mellow Mushroom, Burbank", "accommodation": "Pleasant 1 bedroom apartment in Harlem Brownstone, Burbank"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Burbank", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Dawat-e-Nawab - Radisson Blu, Burbank", "attraction": "Warner Bros.
