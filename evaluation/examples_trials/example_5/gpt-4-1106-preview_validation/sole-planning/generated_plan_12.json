Adjustments are needed to meet the budget constraint. Since the flight costs are fixed and the accommodation for the first night is necessary due to the late arrival, we can adjust the second day's meals and attractions to reduce costs.\n\nRevised Travel Plan:\nDays: 2\nCurrent City: Appleton\nTransportation: -\nBreakfast: New Bakers Shoppee, Appleton, cost: 15, cuisines: Chinese, Pizza, Cafe\nAttraction: The History Museum at the Castle, Appleton (assuming no entrance fee)\nLunch: The Kathis, cost: 15, cuisines: Desserts, Pizza, Mexican, Bakery, Seafood\nDinner: Mathew's Cafe, cost: 13, cuisines: Mexican, Bakery, BBQ, Cafe, Indian\nAccommodation: Cozy room + bright apartment + rooftop lounge, Private room, 1 guest, house rules: No smoking, minimum nights: 1, cost: 666\n\nNumber of people: 1\nTotal cost: 15 (breakfast) + 15 (lunch) + 13 (dinner) + 666 (accommodation) = 709\nAccommodation minimum nights: 1/1\n\nNew Total cost across all days: 1,208 + 709 + 362 = 2,279\n\nThe revised plan still exceeds the budget.

Since the flights and the first night's accommodation are necessary, and the meals have been minimized, the only option left is to find a cheaper accommodation for the second night or to remove some meals or attractions.
