It is not possible to drive from Marquette to Milwaukee in 6 minutes, as the actual driving time is several hours. However, since no flights are allowed and the provided data for self-driving is incorrect, we will assume a cost similar to the drive from Charlotte to Marquette for budgeting purposes. The cost for this leg will be adjusted to 68 to maintain consistency with the other self-driving leg. The total cost will be recalculated accordingly.\n\nAdjusted total cost across all days: 303 + 314 + (68 + 66 x 2) + 510 + 200 = 1,693\n\nRemaining budget: $2,500 - $1,693 = $807\n\nAll attractions, restaurants, and accommodations are selected based on the provided reference information and the constraints of the query.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Charlotte to Marquette", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Charlotte to Marquette, duration: 13 hours 1 min, distance: 1,371 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "The Chop House, Marquette", "accommodation": "Huge Private Room Near Prospect Park, Marquette"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Marquette", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Taste of Balingup, Marquette", "attraction": "Presque Isle Park, Marquette;Marquette Harbor Lighthouse, Marquette;", "lunch": "Ifthar, Marquette", "dinner": "Annapurna Sweet House, Marquette", "accommodation": "Huge Private Room Near Prospect Park, Marquette"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Marquette to Milwaukee", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Marquette to Milwaukee, duration: 6 mins, distance: 2.0 km", "breakfast": "Papa Mexicano, Marquette", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Cool Basil, Milwaukee", "accommodation": "Affordable bedroom in the East Village!, Milwaukee"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Milwaukee", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Berco's, Milwaukee", "attraction": "Milwaukee Art Museum, Milwaukee;Milwaukee Public Museum, Milwaukee;", "lunch": "Frontier, Milwaukee", "dinner": "Doughlicious, Milwaukee", "accommodation": "Affordable bedroom in the East Village!, Milwaukee"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Milwaukee to Charlotte", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Milwaukee to Charlotte, duration: 12 hours 58 mins, distance: 1,369 km", "breakfast": "Shankar Sweets, Milwaukee", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
