Adjustments are needed to meet the budget constraint. Since the accommodation cost is the highest, we can look for a cheaper option.\n\nRevised Accommodation for Days 1 and 2:\nAccommodation: Large Rooms with Bar and PullOut Prime Greenpoint, Appleton, cost: 174, maximum occupancy: 2, house rules: No visitors & No smoking & No pets, minimum nights: 4\n\nRevised Total Cost for Days 1 and 2:\nTotal cost: 542 (flight) + 174 (accommodation) = 716\nTotal cost: 72 (breakfast) + 84 (lunch) + 97 (dinner) + 174 (accommodation) = 427\n\nRevised Total cost across all days: 716 + 427 + 362 = 1,505\n\nThe revised total cost is still over budget.

Since the flight costs are fixed and the accommodation has been minimized, the only option left is to remove the lunch for Day 2:\n\nRevised Total Cost for Day 2 without any meals:\nTotal cost: 174 (accommodation) = 174\n\nRevised Total cost across all days without any meals on Day 2: 716 + 174 + 362 = 1,252\n\nThe plan is still slightly over budget. Given the constraints and the fixed costs of flights and the cheapest accommodation, it is not possible to create a travel plan within the $1,200 budget. Additional budget or changes to the constraints would be required to finalize a feasible travel plan.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from St. Petersburg to Appleton", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3574992, from St. Petersburg to Appleton, Departure Time: 22:51, Arrival Time: 00:42", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "Cozy room + bright apartment + rooftop lounge, Appleton"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Appleton", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Mikata Japanese Steakhouse, Appleton", "attraction": "The History Museum at the Castle, Appleton;Hearthstone Historic House Museum, Appleton;", "lunch": "Swati Snacks, Appleton", "dinner": "Brick 29, Appleton", "accommodation": "Cozy room + bright apartment + rooftop lounge, Appleton"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Appleton to St. Petersburg", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3578689, from Appleton to St. Petersburg, Departure Time: 07:19, Arrival Time: 11:01", "breakfast": "Destination Live, Appleton", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
