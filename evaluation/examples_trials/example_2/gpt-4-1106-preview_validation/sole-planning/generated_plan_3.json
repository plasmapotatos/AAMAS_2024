To adjust the plan within the budget, we can consider the following changes:\n\n- Opt for self-driving from Buffalo to Atlanta instead of flying. This will reduce the transportation cost from $322 to $72.\n- Choose a less expensive accommodation option. For example, \"Spacious private room close St. Barnabas Hospital\" at $144 per night instead of the \"Unique 2BR Apartment\" at $394 per night.\n- Remove paid attractions and opt for free activities or sightseeing.\n\nRevised Travel Plan with Budget Consideration:\n\nDays: 1\nCurrent City: from Buffalo to Atlanta\nTransportation: Self-driving, from Buffalo to Atlanta, duration: 13 hours 7 mins, distance: 1,443 km, cost: $72\nBreakfast: -\nAttraction: Centennial Olympic Park, Atlanta, GA, cost: $0 (free entry)\nLunch: Saffron, Atlanta, cost: $39, cuisines: Tea, Cafe, Fast Food, Seafood\nDinner: Adda, Atlanta, cost: $22, cuisines: Tea, Mexican, Bakery\nAccommodation: Spacious private room close St. Barnabas Hospital, Atlanta, cost: $144, room type: Private room, house rules: No smoking, minimum nights: 2, maximum occupancy: 1\n\nNumber of people: 1\nTotal cost: $72 (Self-driving) + $39 (Lunch) + $22 (Dinner) + $144 (Accommodation) = $277\nAccommodation minimum nights: 1/2\n\nDays: 2\nCurrent City: Atlanta\nTransportation: -\nBreakfast: Baba Au Rhum, Atlanta, cost: $27, cuisines: Desserts, Pizza, Mexican, BBQ, Fast Food\nAttraction: Piedmont Park, Atlanta, GA, cost: $0 (free entry)\nLunch: Asian Bistro, Atlanta, cost: $27, cuisines: Tea, Bakery, Seafood\nDinner: Chef Style, Atlanta, cost: $59, cuisines: Pizza, American, Desserts, Seafood\nAccommodation: Spacious private room close St. Barnabas Hospital, Atlanta, cost: $144, room type: Private room, house rules: No smoking, minimum nights: 2, maximum occupancy: 1\n\nNumber of people: 1\nTotal cost: $27 (Breakfast) + $27 (Lunch) + $59 (Dinner) + $144 (Accommodation) = $257\nAccommodation minimum nights: 2/2\n\nDays: 3\nCurrent City: from Atlanta to Buffalo\nTransportation: Self-driving, from Atlanta to Buffalo, duration: 13 hours 6 mins, distance: 1,443 km, cost: $72\nBreakfast: The Krib, Atlanta, cost: $45, cuisines: Seafood, BBQ, Italian\nAttraction: -\nLunch: -\nDinner: -\nAccommodation: -\n\nNumber of people: 1\nTotal cost: $72 (Self-driving) + $45 (Breakfast) = $117\n\nTotal cost across all days: $277 + $257 + $117 = $651\n\nWith these adjustments, the total cost is now within the budget of $1,100.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Buffalo to Atlanta", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3514187, from Buffalo to Atlanta, Departure Time: 06:51, Arrival Time: 08:40", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "World of Coca-Cola, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Saffron, Atlanta", "dinner": "Adda, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Unique 2BR Apartment, Atlanta"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Atlanta", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Baba Au Rhum, Atlanta", "attraction": "Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Asian Bistro, Atlanta", "dinner": "Chef Style, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Unique 2BR Apartment, Atlanta"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Atlanta to Buffalo", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3502694, from Atlanta to Buffalo, Departure Time: 15:47, Arrival Time: 17:42", "breakfast": "The Krib, Atlanta", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}, {"day": 1, "current_city": "from Buffalo to Atlanta", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Buffalo to Atlanta, duration: 13 hours 7 mins", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Centennial Olympic Park, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Saffron, Atlanta", "dinner": "Adda, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Spacious private room close St. Barnabas Hospital, Atlanta"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Atlanta", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Baba Au Rhum, Atlanta", "attraction": "Piedmont Park, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Asian Bistro, Atlanta", "dinner": "Chef Style, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Spacious private room close St. Barnabas Hospital, Atlanta"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Atlanta to Buffalo", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Atlanta to Buffalo, duration: 13 hours 6 mins", "breakfast": "The Krib, Atlanta", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
