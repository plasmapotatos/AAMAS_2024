To adjust the travel plan to fit the budget, we need to change the transportation method from flights to a more economical option. However, the query specifies that we're not planning on self-driving, and the cost of a taxi is even higher than flights. Given these constraints, it is not possible to create a travel plan within the specified budget of $1,400. \n\nPlease advise if the budget can be increased or if there are other preferences that can be adjusted to reduce costs.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Newark to Savannah", "transportation": "Flight Number: F4070527, from Newark to Savannah, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Sr. Sol 1, Savannah", "accommodation": "Family and Friendly Room, Savannah"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Savannah", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "The Mad Teapot/The Wishing Chair, Savannah", "attraction": "Forsyth Park, Savannah;Wormsloe State Historic Site, Savannah;Savannah Historic District, Savannah", "lunch": "Bosphorous Turkish Cuisine, Savannah", "dinner": "Bake Cuddle, Savannah", "accommodation": "Family and Friendly Room, Savannah"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Savannah to Newark", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3903501, from Savannah to Newark, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Manohar Dairy And Restaurant, Savannah", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
