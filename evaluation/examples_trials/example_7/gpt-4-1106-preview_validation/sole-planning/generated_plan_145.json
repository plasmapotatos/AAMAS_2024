Adjustments to the plan, such as choosing more affordable dining options or accommodations, would be necessary to meet the budget constraint. Additionally, the accommodation \"Loft in Times Square with Roof Balcony\" in Alpena does not allow parties, which is against the query's requirement. However, no other accommodations in Alpena were listed that allow parties. Therefore, this accommodation was chosen as it provides a private room, which is a requirement. The minimum nights for accommodations also exceed the duration of the stay, which may not be feasible. This plan is a starting point and would need further refinement to meet all constraints.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Milwaukee to Alpena (Michigan)", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Milwaukee to Alpena, duration: 7 hours 37 mins, distance: 749 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "A & A Pagliai's Pizza, Alpena (Michigan)", "accommodation": "Loft in Times Square with Roof Balcony, Alpena (Michigan)"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Alpena (Michigan)", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "@Mango, Alpena (Michigan)", "attraction": "Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center, Alpena (Michigan);Besser Museum for Northeast Michigan, Alpena (Michigan);", "lunch": "Shudh Restaurant, Alpena (Michigan)", "dinner": "Maplai, Alpena (Michigan)", "accommodation": "Loft in Times Square with Roof Balcony, Alpena (Michigan)"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Alpena (Michigan) to Kalamazoo (Michigan)", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Alpena to Kalamazoo, duration: 4 hours 33 mins, distance: 464 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Kalamazoo Valley Museum, Kalamazoo (Michigan);Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Kalamazoo (Michigan);", "lunch": "Django, Kalamazoo (Michigan)", "dinner": "Giulios Greek & Italian Restaurant, Kalamazoo (Michigan)", "accommodation": "Sunny, 1 Bedroom in Bedstuy, Brooklyn, Kalamazoo (Michigan)"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Kalamazoo (Michigan)", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Cha cTea, Kalamazoo (Michigan)", "attraction": "Kalamazoo Nature Center, Kalamazoo (Michigan);Air Zoo Aerospace & Science Museum, Kalamazoo (Michigan);", "lunch": "Taco Bell, Kalamazoo (Michigan)", "dinner": "Oxy Lounge, Kalamazoo (Michigan)", "accommodation": "Sunny, 1 Bedroom in Bedstuy, Brooklyn, Kalamazoo (Michigan)"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Kalamazoo (Michigan) to Milwaukee", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Kalamazoo to Milwaukee, duration: 3 hours 45 mins, distance: 382 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
