Adjustments are needed to meet the budget constraint.

Further adjustments are needed, such as choosing less expensive restaurants or skipping some meals or attractions. However, without more detailed cost information for each item, it's challenging to make these adjustments while still meeting all the requirements of the travel plan.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Detroit to La Crosse", "transportation": "Taxi, from Detroit to La Crosse, duration: 8 hours 23 mins, distance: 915 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Goldy's Breakfast Bistro, La Crosse", "accommodation": "Great location-Newly updated-great new features, La Crosse"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "La Crosse", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Hot Palayok, La Crosse", "attraction": "Riverside Park, La Crosse;Grandad Bluff Park, La Crosse;", "lunch": "Hot Stuff, La Crosse", "dinner": "Moti Mahal Delux, La Crosse", "accommodation": "Great location-Newly updated-great new features, La Crosse"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from La Crosse to Appleton", "transportation": "Taxi, from La Crosse to Appleton, duration: 3 hours 2 mins, distance: 273 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "The History Museum at the Castle, Appleton;Hearthstone Historic House Museum, Appleton;", "lunch": "Mikata Japanese Steakhouse, Appleton", "dinner": "Brick 29, Appleton", "accommodation": "Luxury Apartment in Williamsburg!, Appleton"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Appleton", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Colony, Appleton", "attraction": "Butterfly Garden of Wisconsin, Appleton;Gordon Bubolz Nature Preserve, Appleton;", "lunch": "Swati Snacks, Appleton", "dinner": "Destination Live, Appleton", "accommodation": "Luxury Apartment in Williamsburg!, Appleton"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Appleton to Detroit", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3642011, from Appleton to Detroit, Departure Time: 11:47, Arrival Time: 13:51", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
