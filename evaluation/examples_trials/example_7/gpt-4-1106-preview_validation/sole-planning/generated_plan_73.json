To adjust the plan to fit the budget, we can consider the following changes:\n\n- Switch to self-driving from Dallas to Huntsville and back, which costs $53 each way for the vehicle. This would be $106 total for transportation, significantly less than the flights.\n- Choose less expensive restaurants or attractions, or reduce the number of paid attractions.\n- Find a more budget-friendly accommodation option if available.\n\nPlease note that the assumed costs for attractions and the lack of specific pricing for some items may affect the accuracy of this plan. Adjustments would need to be made to ensure the total cost does not exceed the budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Dallas to Huntsville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3609558, from Dallas to Huntsville, Departure Time: 07:03, Arrival Time: 08:51", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Huntsville;", "lunch": "Downtown Grill, Huntsville", "dinner": "Desee Dakshin Coastal Cafe, Huntsville", "accommodation": "Brooklyn Charmer, Close to Everything NYC!, Huntsville"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Huntsville", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Breakfast Hut, Huntsville", "attraction": "Huntsville Botanical Garden, Huntsville;", "lunch": "Moksh The Restro Lounge, Huntsville", "dinner": "Frozen Grillz, Huntsville", "accommodation": "Brooklyn Charmer, Close to Everything NYC!, Huntsville"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Huntsville to Dallas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3593796, from Huntsville to Dallas, Departure Time: 05:24, Arrival Time: 07:19", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
