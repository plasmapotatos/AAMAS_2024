To adjust the plan to fit within the budget, we need to find more cost-effective accommodation options that still meet the requirements (allow children under 10 and entire rooms). Let's revise the accommodation for Days 1 and 2:\n\nRevised Accommodation: Charming Carroll Gardens 2 BR, Atlanta, cost: 576, room type: Entire home/apt, house rules: No parties, minimum nights: 1, maximum occupancy: 4\n\nRevised Total cost for Days 1 and 2: (34 + 39) * 3 + 576 = 405 + 576 = 981\nRevised Total cost for Day 2: (22 + 59 + 75) * 3 + 576 = 468 + 576 = 1,044\n\nRevised Total cost across all days: 981 + 1,044 + 105 = 2,130\n\nThe revised total cost is $2,130, which is slightly over the budget. To further reduce costs, we can opt for a less expensive dinner option on Day 2:\n\nRevised Dinner for Day 2: Taste of Vishal, Atlanta, cost: 13, cuisines: Desserts, Tea, American, Bakery, Indian, Seafood\n\nRevised Total cost for Day 2: (22 + 59 + 13) * 3 + 576 = 282 + 576 = 858\n\nRevised Total cost across all days: 981 + 858 + 105 = 1,944\n\nThe revised total cost is now $1,944, which is within the specified budget of $2,100.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Daytona Beach to Atlanta", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Daytona Beach to Atlanta, duration: 6 hours 18 mins, distance: 696 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Saffron, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Charming Carroll Gardens 2 BR, Atlanta"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Atlanta", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Adda, Atlanta", "attraction": "Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta;World of Coca-Cola, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Chef Style, Atlanta", "dinner": "Taste of Vishal, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Charming Carroll Gardens 2 BR, Atlanta"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Atlanta to Daytona Beach", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Atlanta to Daytona Beach, duration: 6 hours 20 mins, distance: 706 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
