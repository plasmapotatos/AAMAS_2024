Adjustments will need to be made to the plan to reduce costs. This could involve choosing less expensive accommodations, dining options, or transportation methods. Please note that the accommodations chosen allow for parties, as per the query's request. However, the accommodation in Texarkana does not allow for the full party of 3 due to occupancy restrictions, so an additional room may be required, further increasing costs.
