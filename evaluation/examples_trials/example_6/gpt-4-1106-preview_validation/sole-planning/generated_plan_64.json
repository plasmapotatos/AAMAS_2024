It is assumed that the cost of attractions is included in the budget. If there are separate costs for attractions, they would need to be factored into the total cost. The accommodation chosen is for 5 people, so two rooms would be needed to accommodate 7 people, but the reference information does not provide a second accommodation option that fits the entire room requirement. Therefore, the plan assumes that an additional room of the same type is available at the same cost. If this is not the case, adjustments would need to be made.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Salt Lake City to Burbank", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3846241, from Salt Lake City to Burbank, Departure Time: 08:08, Arrival Time: 09:03", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Warner Bros.
