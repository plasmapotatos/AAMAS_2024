Adjustments to the plan are required to meet the budget constraint.

Further adjustments are needed. Let's change the transportation method from Chicago to Orlando to self-driving to save on costs:\n\nRevised Days 5 Transportation:\nTransportation: Self-driving, from Chicago to Orlando, duration: 16 hours 56 mins, distance: 1,858 km, cost: 92\n\nRevised Total cost for Days 5: 46 + 92 = 138\n\nRevised Total cost across all days: 758 + 858 + 541 + 562 + 138 = 2857\n\nThe revised total cost of $2,857 is closer to the budget but still over. We will need to make further adjustments, such as choosing less expensive meals or attractions, to bring the total cost within the $2,700 budget.
