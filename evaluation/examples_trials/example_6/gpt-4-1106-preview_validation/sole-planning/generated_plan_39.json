This discrepancy is due to the lack of information on the minimum stay requirements for each accommodation in the provided data. The plan assumes that the accommodation can be booked for the required number of nights. If this is not the case, alternative accommodation would need to be found. Additionally, the travel plan assumes that the flight and accommodation prices are for one person and that the restaurants and attractions are open and available on the specified dates.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Killeen to Dallas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3592775, from Killeen to Dallas, Departure Time: 16:32, Arrival Time: 17:33", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Dallas;", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "1918 Bistro & Grill, Dallas", "accommodation": "Luxury Williamsburg duplex, private roof terrace, Dallas"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Dallas", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Coconuts Fish Cafe, Dallas", "attraction": "Reunion Tower, Dallas;Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas;Klyde Warren Park, Dallas;", "lunch": "Yanki Sizzlers, Dallas", "dinner": "L'Opera, Dallas", "accommodation": "Luxury Williamsburg duplex, private roof terrace, Dallas"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Dallas to El Paso", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3602430, from Dallas to El Paso, Departure Time: 13:36, Arrival Time: 14:17", "breakfast": "Cafe Gatherings, Dallas", "attraction": "El Paso Zoo and Botanical Gardens, El Paso;El Paso Museum of Art, El Paso;", "lunch": "Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant, El Paso", "dinner": "The Garden Cafe - The Fern, El Paso", "accommodation": "Upper West / Morningside Heights Apt, Near Subway, El Paso"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "El Paso", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Los Beto's, El Paso", "attraction": "Franklin Mountains State Park, El Paso;Chamizal National Memorial, El Paso;", "lunch": "Onesta, El Paso", "dinner": "Downtown Kitchen & Bar - Courtyard by Marriott, El Paso", "accommodation": "Upper West / Morningside Heights Apt, Near Subway, El Paso"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from El Paso to Killeen", "transportation": "Self-driving, from El Paso to Killeen, duration: 8 hours 29 mins, distance: 920 km", "breakfast": "Knight Rider, El Paso", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
