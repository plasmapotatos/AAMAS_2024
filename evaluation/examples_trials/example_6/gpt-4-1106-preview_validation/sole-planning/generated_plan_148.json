Additionally, the accommodation selected for Nashville does not allow smoking, which contradicts the preference for smoking-friendly accommodations. However, no smoking-friendly accommodations were provided in the reference information. The travel plan also assumes that the cost for self-driving is per vehicle, not per person, and that the vehicle can accommodate at least 2 people.
