We can do this by choosing more affordable accommodations, reducing meal costs, and possibly limiting the number of attractions visited or selecting free attractions. Additionally, we may need to consider alternative transportation methods, such as self-driving for all segments, to further reduce costs. However, without specific cost details for each item and alternative options, it is not possible to provide a revised plan that meets all the requirements and stays within the budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Punta Gorda to Pellston", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Punta Gorda to Pellston, duration: 21 hours 40 mins, distance: 2,457 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Pellston Pioneer Park, Pellston", "lunch": "Johnnie Mars, Pellston", "dinner": "Aroos Damascus, Pellston", "accommodation": "Beautiful apartment ~25min from Times Square, Pellston"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Pellston", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Premier Bite, Pellston", "attraction": "Pellston Historical Society Museum, Pellston", "lunch": "Flame & Grill, Pellston", "dinner": "Spezia Bistro, Pellston", "accommodation": "Beautiful apartment ~25min from Times Square, Pellston"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Pellston to Traverse City", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Pellston to Traverse City, duration: 1 hour 49 mins, distance: 137 km", "breakfast": "The Plaza Solitaire, Pellston", "attraction": "Clinch Park, Traverse City", "lunch": "Daily Eats, Traverse City", "dinner": "Dragonfly, Traverse City", "accommodation": "Heart of Soho!
