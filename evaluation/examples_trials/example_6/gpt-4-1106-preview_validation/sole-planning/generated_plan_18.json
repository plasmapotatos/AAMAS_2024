To adjust the plan within the budget, we can consider changing the accommodation to a less expensive option or choosing a different transportation method. However, based on the provided data, the cheapest accommodation is \"The Best little room in Brooklyn\" at $327 per night, and the cheapest transportation is self-driving at $82, but it takes over 14 hours, which is not feasible for a 3-day trip. Therefore, we need to either increase the budget or reduce the number of activities and meals to fit the budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Denver to Palm Springs", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3880999, from Denver to Palm Springs, Departure Time: 11:16, Arrival Time: 12:28", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Palm Springs Art Museum, Palm Springs;", "lunch": "Bar Gernika Basque Pub & Eatery, Palm Springs", "dinner": "Houndstooth Grill & Tavern, Palm Springs", "accommodation": "Brooklyn Gem, Palm Springs"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Palm Springs", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Kahill's Steak-Fish Chophouse, Palm Springs", "attraction": "Moorten Botanical Garden, Palm Springs;", "lunch": "Sugar & Spice - Le Marche, Palm Springs", "dinner": "Pizza Man, Palm Springs", "accommodation": "Brooklyn Gem, Palm Springs"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Palm Springs to Denver", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3870469, from Palm Springs to Denver, Departure Time: 16:00, Arrival Time: 19:12", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, Palm Springs;", "lunch": "Kake Da Hotel, Palm Springs", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
