To adhere to the budget, adjustments must be made to the travel plan, such as choosing more affordable accommodations or dining options. Please note that the accommodation in Durango exceeds the trip duration, and the minimum nights for the selected accommodation in Grand Junction is 3, which aligns with the stay. However, the accommodation in Durango has a minimum stay of 30 nights, which is not suitable for this travel plan.
