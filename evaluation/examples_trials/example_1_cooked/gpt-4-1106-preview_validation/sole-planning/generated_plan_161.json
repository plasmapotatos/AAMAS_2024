Please note that the accommodation on Day 5 does not allow visitors, which is against the specified requirements. An alternative accommodation that allows visitors and fits within the budget should be selected.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Pittsburgh to Rochester", "transportation": "Taxi, from Pittsburgh to Rochester, duration: 4 hours 11 mins, distance: 457 km, Cost: 457", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Atlas World Grill, Rochester", "accommodation": "Sun Filled 18ft Ceiling Duplex Noho/East Village, Rochester"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Rochester", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Hotel Ravisha Continental, Rochester", "attraction": "The Strong National Museum of Play, Rochester;George Eastman Museum, Rochester;", "lunch": "Sree Annapoorna, Rochester", "dinner": "Circus, Rochester", "accommodation": "Sun Filled 18ft Ceiling Duplex Noho/East Village, Rochester"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Rochester to Niagara Falls", "transportation": "Taxi, from Rochester to Niagara Falls, duration: 1 hour 25 mins, distance: 139 km, Cost: 139", "breakfast": "Mister Mughal, Rochester", "attraction": "Journey Behind the Falls, Niagara Falls;Niagara SkyWheel, Niagara Falls;", "lunch": "Tony Roma's, Niagara Falls", "dinner": "Izakaya Kikufuji, Niagara Falls", "accommodation": "Harlem Oasis, Niagara Falls"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Niagara Falls", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Raju Dhaba, Niagara Falls", "attraction": "Cave of the Winds, Niagara Falls;White Water Walk, Niagara Falls;", "lunch": "Scratch, Niagara Falls", "dinner": "Pier 70, Niagara Falls", "accommodation": "Harlem Oasis, Niagara Falls"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Niagara Falls to New York", "transportation": "Taxi, from Niagara Falls to New York, duration: 6 hours 29 mins, distance: 657 km, Cost: 657", "breakfast": "Sri Meenakshi South Indian Food, Niagara Falls", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Seasons 52 Fresh Grill, New York", "accommodation": "Versatile private room in Harlem/Hamilton Heights!, New York"}, {"day": 6, "current_city": "New York", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Gurgaon Hights, New York", "attraction": "Top of The Rock, New York;One World Observatory, New York;", "lunch": "Lord of the Drinks Forum, New York", "dinner": "Rambhog, New York", "accommodation": "Versatile private room in Harlem/Hamilton Heights!, New York"}, {"day": 7, "current_city": "from New York to Pittsburgh", "transportation": "Taxi, from New York to Pittsburgh, duration: 5 hours 57 mins, distance: 594 km, Cost: 594", "breakfast": "Green Chick Chop, New York", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
