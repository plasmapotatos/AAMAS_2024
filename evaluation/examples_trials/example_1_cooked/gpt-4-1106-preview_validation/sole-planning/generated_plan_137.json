To adjust, we can opt for a cheaper flight on Day 1: Flight Number: F3787889, cost: 155, which reduces the total cost by (200-155) x 2 = 90. The new total cost across all days would be 2236 - 90 = 2146. To further reduce costs, we can choose a cheaper accommodation option, such as \"Top floor of an amazing duplex\" at a cost of 509 for two nights, which would reduce the accommodation cost by (178-509/2) x 4 = 154. The final total cost would then be 2146 - 154 = 1992, which is within the budget.\n\nCuisines: The prompt specifies no cuisines, so all cuisines constraints are satisfied.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Cincinnati to Philadelphia", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3794475, from Cincinnati to Philadelphia, Departure Time: 07:44, Arrival Time: 09:08", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "Hong Kong Cafe, Philadelphia", "dinner": "Red Ginger Sushi, Grill & Bar, Philadelphia", "accommodation": "Industrial Loft Living in NYC, Philadelphia"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Philadelphia", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Marukame Udon, Philadelphia", "attraction": "The Franklin Institute, Philadelphia;Liberty Bell, Philadelphia;", "lunch": "The Moon Under Water, Philadelphia", "dinner": "Pind Balluchi, Philadelphia", "accommodation": "Industrial Loft Living in NYC, Philadelphia"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Philadelphia to Cincinnati", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3793489, from Philadelphia to Cincinnati, Departure Time: 10:37, Arrival Time: 12:28", "breakfast": "Brothers Dhaba, Philadelphia", "attraction": "Philadelphia's Magic Gardens, Philadelphia;Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia;", "lunch": "Gurdas Ram Jalebi Wala, Philadelphia", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
