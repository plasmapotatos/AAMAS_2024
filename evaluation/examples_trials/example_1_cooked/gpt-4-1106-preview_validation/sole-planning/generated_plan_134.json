To adjust the plan within the budget, we need to consider different transportation or accommodation options. However, since the query specifies not to self-drive and the requirement for entire rooms suitable for children under 10, the accommodation options are limited. We may need to choose a less expensive flight or adjust dining options to stay within budget.\n\nPlease note that the accommodation chosen has a minimum stay of 7 nights, which is not suitable for a 3-day trip. We would need to find an alternative accommodation that allows for a shorter stay and is suitable for children under 10. However, the provided data does not include such an option.
