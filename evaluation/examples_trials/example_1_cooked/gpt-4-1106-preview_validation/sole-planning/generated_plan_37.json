To adjust for this, we can consider changing the flight on Day 5 to a cheaper option, such as Flight Number: F3670009, which costs $127 instead of $169. This change would bring the total cost down to $2196, which is still over budget. Further adjustments, such as choosing a less expensive dinner on Day 4 or opting for self-driving instead of flying on one of the travel days, may be necessary to meet the budget constraint.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Albuquerque to Houston", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3857472, from Albuquerque to Houston, Departure Time: 15:31, Arrival Time: 18:27", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Jalapenos, Houston", "accommodation": "Spacious room in front of prospect park, Houston"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Houston", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Super Bakery, Houston", "attraction": "Space Center Houston, Houston;Houston Museum of Natural Science, Houston;", "lunch": "Sheetla Dhaba, Houston", "dinner": "Royal Mart, Houston", "accommodation": "Spacious room in front of prospect park, Houston"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Houston to Dallas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3667579, from Houston to Dallas, Departure Time: 09:26, Arrival Time: 10:41", "breakfast": "Matchbox, Houston", "attraction": "The Dallas World Aquarium, Dallas;The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Dallas;", "lunch": "Coconuts Fish Cafe, Dallas", "dinner": "1918 Bistro & Grill, Dallas", "accommodation": "Fresh Budget Room, Dallas"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Dallas", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Yanki Sizzlers, Dallas", "attraction": "Reunion Tower, Dallas;Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas;", "lunch": "Delhicacy, Dallas", "dinner": "L'Opera, Dallas", "accommodation": "Fresh Budget Room, Dallas"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Dallas to Albuquerque", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3669350, from Dallas to Albuquerque, Departure Time: 10:26, Arrival Time: 11:20", "breakfast": "Cafe Gatherings, Dallas", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
