To adjust the plan within the budget, we can consider changing the accommodation to a more affordable option or altering the transportation method. However, the provided accommodation data does not include pet-friendly options, which is a requirement for the stay. Additionally, the cost of the restaurants chosen for French, Mexican, American, and Mediterranean cuisines has contributed to exceeding the budget.
