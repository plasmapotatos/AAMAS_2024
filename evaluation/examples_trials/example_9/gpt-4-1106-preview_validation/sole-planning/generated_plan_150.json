Adjustments are needed to meet the budget constraint. Since the accommodations in Austin are significantly over budget, we need to find a more affordable option that allows visitors.

Further adjustments are needed, such as choosing less expensive restaurants or reducing the number of attractions visited. However, given the constraints of the query, it is challenging to create a plan that includes all required details and stays within the budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Cedar Rapids to Dallas, Texas", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Cedar Rapids to Dallas, duration: 12 hours 26 mins, distance: 1,324 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Dallas;Reunion Tower, Dallas;", "lunch": "Coconuts Fish Cafe, Dallas", "dinner": "1918 Bistro & Grill, Dallas", "accommodation": "Luxury Williamsburg duplex, private roof terrace, Dallas"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Dallas, Texas", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Cafe Gatherings, Dallas", "attraction": "Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas;The Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, Dallas;", "lunch": "Yanki Sizzlers, Dallas", "dinner": "L'Opera, Dallas", "accommodation": "Luxury Williamsburg duplex, private roof terrace, Dallas"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Dallas to Austin, Texas", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Dallas to Austin, duration: 2 hours 53 mins, distance: 314 km", "breakfast": "Drifters Cafe, Dallas", "attraction": "Texas Capitol, Austin;Zilker Metropolitan Park, Austin;", "lunch": "Wildflour Cafe + Bakery, Austin", "dinner": "The Kasbah, Austin", "accommodation": "Entire 2 bedroom top floor in Clinton Hill, Austin"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Austin, Texas", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Moksha, Austin", "attraction": "Museum of the Weird, Austin;Cathedral of Junk, Austin;", "lunch": "Mehfil-e-Handi, Austin", "dinner": "Tandoori Nights, Austin", "accommodation": "Entire 2 bedroom top floor in Clinton Hill, Austin"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Austin to Cedar Rapids", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Austin to Cedar Rapids, duration: 15 hours 5 mins, distance: 1,695 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
