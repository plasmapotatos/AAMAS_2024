To adhere to the budget, we need to make adjustments. Since the accommodations are the most expensive part, we can look for a cheaper option. Let's revise the plan with a more affordable accommodation:\n\nRevised Accommodation for Days 1 and 2:\nAccommodation: Comfy King Bed Feet from Subway, Detroit, cost: 568, room type: Private room, house rules: No parties, minimum nights: 3, maximum occupancy: 1\n\nSince the accommodation is a private room and we have two people, we need to book two rooms.\n\nRevised Total cost for Days 1 and 2: 121 * 2 + (28 + 40) * 2 + 568 * 2 = 121 * 2 + 68 * 2 + 1136 = 242 + 136 + 1136 = 1514\n\nRevised Total cost across all days: 1514 + 1514 + 194 = 3222\n\nThe revised plan still exceeds the budget. We need to find an even cheaper accommodation or adjust the meal and transportation costs. However, based on the provided accommodation options, it seems challenging to fit the travel plan within the specified budget of $2,200 while meeting all the requirements, especially considering the constraints on smoking-permitted accommodations and non-shared rooms.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Nashville to Detroit", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3557342, from Nashville to Detroit, Departure Time: 10:52, Arrival Time: 13:17", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit;Detroit Historical Museum, Detroit;", "lunch": "Southern Bliss Bakery, Detroit", "dinner": "A Dong Restaurant, Detroit", "accommodation": "Romantic Top Floor Brownstone in Crown Heights, Detroit"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Detroit", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "BMG - All Day Dining, Detroit", "attraction": "Campus Martius Park, Detroit;Motown Museum, Detroit;Michigan Science Center, Detroit;", "lunch": "Vapour Pub & Brewery, Detroit", "dinner": "Bistro Flamme Bois, Detroit", "accommodation": "Romantic Top Floor Brownstone in Crown Heights, Detroit"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Detroit to Nashville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3525027, from Detroit to Nashville, Departure Time: 08:51, Arrival Time: 09:19", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
