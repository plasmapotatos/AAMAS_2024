To adjust the plan within the budget, we can consider the following changes:\n\n- Opt for a less expensive accommodation option if available.\n- Reduce meal costs by choosing more budget-friendly restaurants.\n- Check for any discounts or deals on flights or accommodations.\n\nPlease note that the accommodation chosen has a minimum stay of 7 nights, which does not fit the 3-day travel plan. We would need to find an alternative accommodation that allows for a shorter stay and is suitable for children under 10.
