Additionally, the accommodation in Dallas exceeds the minimum stay requirement, which may not be feasible for a 5-day trip. Adjustments would need to be made to ensure the itinerary fits the budget and constraints.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Albuquerque to Houston", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3884406, from Albuquerque to Houston, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Jalapenos, Houston", "accommodation": "Sunny and Airy near Manhattan, Houston"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Houston", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Super Bakery, Houston", "attraction": "Space Center Houston, Houston;Houston Museum of Natural Science, Houston;", "lunch": "Sheetla Dhaba, Houston", "dinner": "The BrewMaster - The Mix Fine Dine, Houston", "accommodation": "Sunny and Airy near Manhattan, Houston"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Houston to Dallas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3718973, from Houston to Dallas, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Royal Mart, Houston", "attraction": "The Dallas World Aquarium, Dallas;The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Dallas;", "lunch": "Coconuts Fish Cafe, Dallas", "dinner": "1918 Bistro & Grill, Dallas", "accommodation": "Luxury Williamsburg duplex, private roof terrace, Dallas"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Dallas", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Yanki Sizzlers, Dallas", "attraction": "Reunion Tower, Dallas;Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas;", "lunch": "Delhicacy, Dallas", "dinner": "L'Opera, Dallas", "accommodation": "Luxury Williamsburg duplex, private roof terrace, Dallas"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Dallas to Albuquerque", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3960534, from Dallas to Albuquerque, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Cafe Gatherings, Dallas", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
