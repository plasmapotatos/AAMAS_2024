Since the query requires pet-friendly accommodations, we would need to confirm with the property owners or find alternative listings that explicitly allow pets.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from San Jose to Portland", "transportation": "Self-driving, from San Jose to Portland, duration: 10 hours 14 mins, distance: 1,073 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Nacho Mamas Burritos, Portland", "accommodation": "Charming Bushwick Shared Space, Portland"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Portland", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Sethi's Delicacy, Portland", "attraction": "Lan Su Chinese Garden, Portland", "lunch": "Cactus Flower Cafe Navarre, Portland", "dinner": "Desi Zaika, Portland", "accommodation": "Charming Bushwick Shared Space, Portland"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Portland to San Jose", "transportation": "Self-driving from Portland to San Jose, duration: 10 hours 20 mins, distance: 1,074 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
