Additionally, the accommodation chosen does not allow visitors, which is against the specified constraints. The accommodation also exceeds the minimum night stay requirement for the travel dates. Therefore, this plan does not meet the constraints and needs to be revised.\n\nRevised Travel Plan:\n\nUnfortunately, based on the available data, it is not possible to create a valid travel plan that meets all the specified constraints within the $2,000 budget. The flight costs alone for two people exceed the budget, and the accommodations listed either do not allow visitors or are too expensive. Additionally, the minimum nights for the available accommodations do not match the duration of the trip. Therefore, we would need to either increase the budget, adjust the travel dates to meet the minimum accommodation nights, or consider different transportation and accommodation options that are not provided in the given data.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Los Angeles to Detroit", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3548634, from Los Angeles to Detroit, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "A Dong Restaurant, Detroit", "accommodation": "Fashion Designer Studio - Entire Apartment, Detroit"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Detroit", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "BMG - All Day Dining, Detroit", "attraction": "Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit;Detroit Historical Museum, Detroit;", "lunch": "Zabardast Indian Kitchen, Detroit", "dinner": "Bistro Flamme Bois, Detroit", "accommodation": "Fashion Designer Studio - Entire Apartment, Detroit"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Detroit to Los Angeles", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3545846, from Detroit to Los Angeles, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Southern Bliss Bakery, Detroit", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
