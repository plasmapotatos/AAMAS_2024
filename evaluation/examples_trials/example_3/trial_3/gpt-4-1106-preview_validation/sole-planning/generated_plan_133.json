To adjust the plan within the budget, we need to find more affordable accommodation options or reduce meal costs. However, based on the provided accommodation options, the cheapest accommodation that allows smoking is \"Chic Historic Harlem Brownstone\" at $526 per night, which already exceeds the budget when considering the cost for two nights. Therefore, it is not possible to create a travel plan within the specified budget given the constraints on accommodation and the prohibition of flight-based transportation.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Houston to Pensacola", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Houston to Pensacola, duration: 7 hours 38 mins, distance: 845 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Frog Hollow Tavern, Pensacola", "accommodation": "Chic Historic Harlem Brownstone, Pensacola"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Pensacola", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Berry Patch Restaurant, Pensacola", "attraction": "Historic Pensacola Village, Pensacola;Pensacola Museum of Art, Pensacola;", "lunch": "Bailey's Bar-B-Que, Pensacola", "dinner": "Watershed Cafe, Pensacola", "accommodation": "Chic Historic Harlem Brownstone, Pensacola"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Pensacola to Houston", "transportation": "Self-driving from Pensacola to Houston, duration: 7 hours 37 mins, distance: 845 km", "breakfast": "Blue Point Grill, Pensacola", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
