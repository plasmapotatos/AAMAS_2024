Adjustments need to be made to fit within the budget. Since the taxi costs are significantly high, we may need to reconsider the transportation options or the cities chosen to visit to reduce the overall cost. However, as per the query, self-driving is not an option, and there are no available flights for some of the routes on the specified dates. Therefore, it may not be possible to create an itinerary that meets all the requirements within the given budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Detroit to La Crosse", "transportation": "Taxi from Detroit to La Crosse, duration: 8 hours 23 mins, distance: 915 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Goldy's Breakfast Bistro, La Crosse", "accommodation": "Great location-Newly updated-great new features, La Crosse"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "La Crosse", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Hot Palayok, La Crosse", "attraction": "Riverside Park, La Crosse;Grandad Bluff Park, La Crosse;", "lunch": "Moti Mahal Delux, La Crosse", "dinner": "Chacha Chicken, La Crosse", "accommodation": "Great location-Newly updated-great new features, La Crosse"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from La Crosse to Appleton", "transportation": "Taxi from La Crosse to Appleton, duration: 3 hours 2 mins, distance: 273 km", "breakfast": "Bakelicious 18, La Crosse", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Mikata Japanese Steakhouse, Appleton", "accommodation": "Luxury Apartment in Williamsburg!, Appleton"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Appleton", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Destination Live, Appleton", "attraction": "The History Museum at the Castle, Appleton;Hearthstone Historic House Museum, Appleton;", "lunch": "Swati Snacks, Appleton", "dinner": "Colony, Appleton", "accommodation": "Luxury Apartment in Williamsburg!, Appleton"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Appleton to Detroit", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3642011, from Appleton to Detroit, duration: 1 hour 4 minutes", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
