However, the provided accommodations data does not include any options that are both visitor-friendly and within the budget constraints.\n- We could also consider cheaper meal options or remove some attractions to save costs.\n\nSince the provided data does not include any accommodations that are both visitor-friendly and within the budget, and given the constraints of the query, it is not possible to create a feasible itinerary within the $1,200 budget.
