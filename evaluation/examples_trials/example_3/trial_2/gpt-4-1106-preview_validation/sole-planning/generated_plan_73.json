To adjust the plan to fit the budget, we can change the flight on Day 1 to a less expensive option:\n\nAdjusted Day 1 Transportation: Flight F3601769, from Dallas to Huntsville, cost: $129 per person\nAdjusted Total cost for Day 1: 4 x $129 (flight) + 4 x $74 (dinner) + $290 (accommodation) = $986\n\nAdjusted Total cost across all days: $986 (Day 1) + $1,218 (Day 2) + $644 (Day 3) = $2,848\n\nThe cost is still over budget. We can further adjust by selecting a less expensive accommodation:\n\nAdjusted Accommodation for Day 1 and Day 2: Brooklyn Charmer, Close to Everything NYC!, cost: $568, entire home/apt\n\nAdjusted Total cost for Day 1: 4 x $129 (flight) + 4 x $74 (dinner) + $568 (accommodation) = $1,264\nAdjusted Total cost for Day 2: 4 x $81 (breakfast) + 4 x $77 (lunch) + 4 x $96 (dinner) + $568 (accommodation) = $1,492\n\nAdjusted Total cost across all days: $1,264 (Day 1) + $1,492 (Day 2) + $644 (Day 3) = $3,400\n\nThe cost is still over budget. We need to make further adjustments. Let's change the dinner options to more affordable ones:\n\nAdjusted Dinner for Day 1: Cherry Comet, cost: $16 per person\nAdjusted Dinner for Day 2: Hunger Strike, cost: $37 per person\n\nAdjusted Total cost for Day 1: 4 x $129 (flight) + 4 x $16 (dinner) + $568 (accommodation) = $1,136\nAdjusted Total cost for Day 2: 4 x $81 (breakfast) + 4 x $77 (lunch) + 4 x $37 (dinner) + $568 (accommodation) = $1,360\n\nAdjusted Total cost across all days: $1,136 (Day 1) + $1,360 (Day 2) + $644 (Day 3) = $3,140\n\nWe are still over budget. We will need to find additional cost savings, potentially by selecting more affordable meal options or adjusting the attractions visited. However, without further details on costs and options, we cannot make additional adjustments within the constraints of this exercise.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Dallas to Huntsville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3601769, from Dallas to Huntsville", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Cherry Comet, Huntsville", "accommodation": "Brooklyn Charmer, Close to Everything NYC!, Huntsville"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Huntsville", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Breakfast Hut, Huntsville", "attraction": "U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Huntsville", "lunch": "Moksh The Restro Lounge, Huntsville", "dinner": "Hunger Strike, Huntsville", "accommodation": "Brooklyn Charmer, Close to Everything NYC!, Huntsville"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Huntsville to Dallas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3607633, from Huntsville to Dallas", "breakfast": "Cherry Comet, Huntsville", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
