To adhere to the budget, we need to make adjustments to the plan. However, given the constraints and the provided data, it is not feasible to create a travel plan within the budget while meeting all requirements, especially considering the high cost of accommodations and the no-flight constraint. \n\nPlease note that the accommodation costs are based on the assumption that two non-shared rooms are required for two people, which significantly increases the total cost. If the travelers are willing to share a room, the cost could be reduced. Additionally, the cost of attractions has not been included, which would further increase the total cost. \n\nTo fit the travel plan within the budget, we would need to consider different accommodations, potentially adjust the number of cities visited, or extend the flexibility on the transportation and accommodation constraints.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Minneapolis to Nashville", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Minneapolis to Nashville, duration: 12 hours 45 mins, distance: 1,420 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Bangkok 1, Nashville", "accommodation": "Huge 2 Bedroom, Great Location, Express Metro, Nashville"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Nashville", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Veg Hut, Nashville", "attraction": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Nashville;Nashville Zoo at Grassmere, Nashville;", "lunch": "The Toddy Shop, Nashville", "dinner": "Smoke House Deli, Nashville", "accommodation": "Huge 2 Bedroom, Great Location, Express Metro, Nashville"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Nashville to Knoxville", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Nashville to Knoxville, duration: 2 hours 42 mins, distance: 290 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "Cafe Arabelle, Knoxville", "dinner": "Les 3 Brasseurs, Knoxville", "accommodation": "Beautiful & Private Manhattan Room, Knoxville"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Knoxville", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Cafe Coffee Day, Knoxville", "attraction": "World's Fair Park, Knoxville;Knoxville Museum of Art, Knoxville;", "lunch": "Mamagoto, Knoxville", "dinner": "Burger Planet, Knoxville", "accommodation": "Beautiful & Private Manhattan Room, Knoxville"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Knoxville to Minneapolis", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Knoxville to Minneapolis, duration: 13 hours 58 mins, distance: 1,529 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
