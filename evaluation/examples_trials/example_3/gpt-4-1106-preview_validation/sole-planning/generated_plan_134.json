To adjust the plan within the budget, we can consider the following changes:\n\n- Opt for a less expensive accommodation option if available.\n- Reduce meal costs by choosing more budget-friendly restaurants.\n- Re-evaluate transportation options for a more economical choice.\n\nPlease note that the accommodation chosen has a minimum stay of 7 nights, which does not fit the 3-day travel plan. We would need to find an alternative accommodation that allows for a shorter stay and is suitable for children under 10. Additionally, the total cost needs to be within the specified budget of $1,200. Since the provided data does not include a cheaper accommodation option that fits the criteria, we would need additional information to complete the travel plan within the budget and constraints.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Columbus to Newark", "transportation": "Flight Number: F4076294, from Columbus to Newark, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Artistry, Newark", "accommodation": "Gramercy One Bedroom w Two Beds, Newark"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Newark", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Mirage Restro Bar, Newark", "attraction": "The Newark Museum of Art, Newark;Branch Brook Park, Newark;", "lunch": "Angeethi Restaurant, Newark", "dinner": "Escape Terrace Bar Kitchen, Newark", "accommodation": "Gramercy One Bedroom w Two Beds, Newark"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Newark to Columbus", "transportation": "Flight Number: F4076752, from Newark to Columbus, Departure Time: -, Arrival Time: -", "breakfast": "Harmann Restaurant, Newark", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
