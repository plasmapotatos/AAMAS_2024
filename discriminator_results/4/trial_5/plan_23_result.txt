The provided travel planning example appears to be relatively thorough and encompasses various important factors needed for a detailed itinerary. Let's break down the effectiveness of the example against the commonsense constraints:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary begins in San Jose and returns there after visiting the two cities in Idaho, fulfilling a logical travel loop, and adheres to the requirement of visiting two cities. This meets the expectation of a reasonable itinerary.

2. **Valid Transportation**: The example outlines the transportation modes explicitly, detailing flight and taxi options with costs and relevant information. It identifies different transportation types appropriately based on the cities.

3. **Valid Restaurants**: The example includes meals across different categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and provides specific restaurant names that align with the specified cuisines (Indian and French), ensuring there's a satisfactory range of dining options.

4. **Valid Attractions**: Daily attractions are included, with varied options provided each day. The attractions cited match their respective cities, ensuring relevance.

5. **Valid Accommodation**: There are clear references to accommodations, complete with cost details and policies, demonstrating an understanding of necessary lodging for the group.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day provides a full schedule that associates the current city with activities and meals.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The transportation and meal items provided suggest they adhere to requirements and match the specified cities.

8. **Absent Information**: The majority of necessary information is covered for each day, with no significant gaps.

The overall plan adheres closely to the commonsense constraints and provides detailed, relevant, and logically sequenced information. However, there are areas where clarity could improve, such as the specifics of the attractions and ensuring all meals are covered for each day. Additionally, the final cost calculations are somewhat unclear given that the total cost seems to average some calculations and may need to be explicitly broken down for transparency.

Based on these evaluations, I would rate the effectiveness of the example at 85 out of 100. It is generally strong, with only minor improvements needed for perfection.
