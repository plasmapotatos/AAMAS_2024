The evaluation script includes a comprehensive set of functions that assess various aspects of a travel itinerary, such as valid visiting cities, transportation methods, accommodations, meals, attractions, and more. The example provided for the travel plan covers a wide array of these evaluation aspects, including:

1. **Valid Transportation**: Flights are clearly specified along with their details.
2. **Attractions**: Each day, there are attractions listed, ensuring no repetition and valid location associations.
3. **Meals**: Meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are included, with proper costs noted for each day.
4. **Accommodations**: The details include names of accommodations, costs, occupancy, and minimum night requirements.
5. **Days**: The entire span of the trip is covered with calculations for costs and a clear progression through different cities.
6. **Budget**: The total cost is calculated and explicitly stated, adhering to the budgetary constraints.
7. **City Sequence**: The order of cities visited makes sense, and the final day returns to the original city.

However, there are instances where some aspects could be improved. For example, some meals are marked with "-", which might imply insufficient detail for a complete evaluation. This could be flagged by the script's evaluation regarding the absence of meal information. Also, clarity on additional expenses related to attractions and transportation could enhance the transparency of the plan. 

Despite the mentioned nuances, the plan does a good job at covering the required common-sense constraints and fulfills most of the evaluation functions listed in the script.

Considering the overall coverage of the evaluation functions, completeness of the itinerary, and reasonable details, I would rate this example at 85, recognizing it is strong but has room for improvement regarding meal specification.
