The example provided offers a detailed travel itinerary that includes crucial components necessary for evaluating its adherence to commonsense constraints. Here's the reasoning for the score:

1. **City Validity**: The itinerary covers cities (San Jose, Boise, Idaho Falls) mentioned in the request and explicitly states the cities visited daily, conforming to the query about visiting two cities in Idaho.

2. **Transportation Information**: The itinerary specifies transportation modes. There are appropriate values for flights, taxis, and where transportation is not applicable. This addresses the relevant evaluations, ensuring valid modes of transport are chosen according to the criteria.

3. **Meals and Dining**: The meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are distinct for each day, ensuring no repetitions. This adheres to constraints concerning restaurant options and variety, as mentioned in the evaluation.

4. **Attractions**: Each day lists attractions that are relevant to the cities visited. There are no overlaps or repeated attractions listed, solidifying the itinerary's adherence to commonsense constraints.

5. **Accommodations**: Accommodations are provided for multiple days, including crucial details like costs, maximum occupancy, and minimum night rules, aligning with housing constraints in the evaluation script.

6. **Cost Calculations**: Cost summaries for meals, transport, and accommodations are provided, contributing an overall budget check that accommodates the travel context and specified budget.

7. **Cuskine Preferences**: The itinerary directly refers to the requested cuisines (Indian and French), and all relevant meals match these preferences. 

Overall, the example covers all necessary evaluation aspects: city sequence, meal variety, accommodation validity, transportation correctness, and attraction relevance, making it very informative and effective for evaluating a travel plan. 

Given these points, I would rate the example a score of **95** for its thoroughness and adherence to all required constraints while noting that it could still contain minor areas for improvement or clarification on cost calculation methods or cuisine matches each day.
