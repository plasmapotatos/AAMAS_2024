To evaluate the provided example for its effectiveness in covering the commonsense constraint metric, we need to consider several key aspects:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The travel plan starts in Las Vegas and ends in Denver with a clear connection back to Las Vegas, satisfying the itinerary's requirement that the first and last city are the same.

2. **Valid City Sequence**: The sequence of visiting cities is also logical. The plan details moving from Las Vegas to Denver, followed by a return to Las Vegas, which validates the circular trip.

3. **Valid Transportation Methods**: Transportation is specified adequately, with self-driving mentioned for the outbound leg. However, the return leg lacks a declared transportation method, which could create ambiguity.

4. **Accommodations**: There's a consistent mention of accommodations in Denver for the first two days, including explicit rules about minimum nights. However, on the third day returning to Las Vegas, the accommodation section is left blank, which could imply a lack of planning or a traveling decision not specified.

5. **Restaurant Choices**: Meals are provided for each day, with different establishments outlined, fulfilling the requirement that meals are chosen in different locations and not repeated.

6. **Attraction Listings**: Day 2 mentions attractions, showing engagement with local activities. However, Day 1 and Day 3 lack attraction visits, which could suggest missed opportunities for visitor engagement.

7. **Cost Calculations**: The cost breakdown across different days is calculated accurately, but it is necessary to check if it effectively aligns with the budget stated in the query.

While the overall structure of the travel plan meets several constraints, the missing transportation information for the return leg, and the blank accommodation detail for the last day raises concerns about the planâ€™s completeness. 

Given these observations, I would rate the example as follows:

- The structure is clear and mostly meets the requirements.
- However, the gaps in transportation specifications and the accommodation for the last day introduce potential issues that could affect its overall efficacy as a comprehensive travel plan.

Based on this analysis, I would score the prompt's example 75 out of 100, as it does a good job but misses critical details that prevent it from being fully optimal.
