Reasoning:
The provided example outlines a three-day travel plan from Washington to Orlando. It includes details on transportation, meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), attractions, and accommodation. However, it has several weaknesses when evaluated against the commonsense constraint metrics defined in the evaluation script:

1. **Transportation**: The example contains conflicting transportation modes (self-driving for both departure and return but not listed for Day 2). The criteria for valid transportation states that if "Self-driving" and "Flight" are mentioned, it is considered conflicting. Even though flight is not mentioned, there's an inconsistency since Day 2 lacks transportation details entirely.

2. **Attractions and Meals**: The attractions for Day 2 consist of two items, but there is no clear logic regarding their validity concerning city and cuisine. Moreover, meals are incomplete, particularly for Day 1 and Day 2, where breakfast is marked as "-", which may suggest it needs to be filled according to the commonsense checks regarding meal distribution.

3. **Lack of Variability**: Meals for certain days are not diversified enough. If the goal is to sample different cuisines, lunchtime suggests pizza consistently which might not be realistic considering the guideline expectations of varied meals.

4. **Accommodation**: The communication around accommodation is lacking for the last day, where accommodation is not listed, leaving room for lack of clarity on where the travelers should stay.

Overall, this travel plan misses out on fulfilling key criteria and lacks consistency, which may lead to erroneous outputs during validation.

Considering these weaknesses, I would rate the effectiveness of the example as 40 out of 100, as it does provide a substantial amount of content but fails quite significantly in adhering to evaluation constraints and logical flow.
