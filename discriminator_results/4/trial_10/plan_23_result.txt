The provided travel plan example effectively covers a variety of constraints that the evaluation script checks. It includes details about transportation for each day, accommodations, meals, attractions, the total number of people, and the overall cost, ensuring that various key points of each evaluation function are satisfied. 

**Reasoning:**
1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary specifies several cities, and the order of travel seems reasonable. The start (San Jose) and end cities (also San Jose) ensure a closed trip, which is important.
   
2. **Valid Restaurants**: All meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) are provided, and there appears to be no repetition of any restaurant across days, which fits the validation for restaurants.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Multiple attractions have been included per day, and none seem to repeat, which meets the validation requirements.

4. **Valid Transportation**: The transportation is specified uniquely for the departure and arrival, and the transportation modes are well-defined (flights and taxis) with all necessary parameters included.

5. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day summarizes the activities in a particular city, maintaining clear references to the corresponding meals, attractions, and accommodations.

6. **Valid Accommodation**: The example adheres to restrictions regarding minimum nights in accommodations and specifies which places are being used for lodging.

7. **Not Absent**: All requested information is present for each day, fulfilling the required checks without missing any critical details.

8. **Cost Calculations**: The total costs and calculations for meals and accommodations are clearly outlined, reflecting an accurate accounting for the entire trip cost and aligning with the budget provided.

9. **Cuisine Constraints**: The prompt's specific request for Indian and French cuisines is addressed, and all meals adhere to this requirement.

Overall, the itinerary comprehensively addresses each criterion outlined in the evaluation script and can likely satisfy the commonsense constraints with a high degree of success.

Given these points, I would score this example a **score of 90**, indicating that it does meet a great deal of the required conditions but maybe could have a bit more variety or clarity for certain specifics.
