To assess the quality of the travel planning example provided, we need to evaluate how well it covers the various constraints outlined in the evaluation script. The example details a comprehensive itinerary for a group traveling to Texas, which includes multiple cities, meals, accommodations, and transportation modes. Here are the key points of evaluation:

1. **City Sequence:** The itinerary starts and ends in Seattle, traveling through Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. This forms a reasonable pattern for city visits, respecting the round trip requirement.
  
2. **Valid Cities:** All cities mentioned (Dallas, Houston, San Antonio) are valid, and fits within Texas, as required by the prompt.

3. **Transportation Validity:** The itinerary specifies flights for city-to-city travel, aligning with the user's preference of not wanting to self-drive. The flight numbers are well-detailed, adding another layer of authenticity, even though the return transportation on the last day is mentioned with specifics.

4. **Restaurant Validity:** The meals in the plan include breakfast, lunch, and dinner options with names and prices, ensuring no meal slots are left empty across the days, which should satisfy the meal constraints.

5. **Accommodation Validity:** Each day lists a valid accommodation with details on cost, capacity, and rules. Importantly, it maintains the required minimum nights for certain stays.

6. **Total Costs:** Each leg and total cost are calculated correctly and match the meals, transportation, and accommodation costs provided.

7. **Flexibility:** There are provisions for tourist attractions in every city visited, contributing to a full experience.

8. **Constraints Followed:** The example adheres to constraints like total budget, accommodations that allow parties, and meals that conform to budget allowances.

Based on these evaluations, the example appears to provide thorough and diverse coverage of the requirements stipulated in the evaluation script, showing clarity, completeness, and fulfillment of specified constraints.

Considering all of the above, I would give the example a score of **95**, as it covers almost all required areas very well but could improve slightly in the flow of transportation on the last day or mentioning potential meal options in greater detail. 

<output>95</output>
