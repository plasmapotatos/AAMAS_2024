The provided travel planning example is formatted well and covers various aspects of a travel itinerary. It includes key elements such as days, current city, transportation, meals, attractions, accommodations, total cost, and specific requirements like cuisine preferences. 

Here's a breakdown of how the example measures against the commonsense constraints:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The example presents a logical progression through cities, starting from St. Louis to multiple locations in California, before returning to St. Louis, ensuring a reasonable route.
2. **Valid Restaurants**: The choice of restaurants includes those that match the stated cuisine preferences (American and Chinese), indicating a good alignment with the traveler’s requests.
3. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions mentioned for each city are popular and appropriate for those locations, fulfilling this constraint.
4. **Valid Accommodation**: Accommodations are clearly described with financial details and include minimum night requirements for some entries. They reflect real options that travelers would encounter.
5. **Valid Transportation**: The transportation details are well-defined, including flight information and taxi usage, which suit the journey's requirements.
6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day features consistent information across meals and activities, supporting validity.
7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: Assumes use of a dataset that might validate transportation, restaurants, and accommodations, which all appear explored logically.
8. **Absent Information**: The plan includes all necessary information to avoid “absent” entries, though a few meals are left blank, which could cause concern in a strict evaluation.
9. **Valid Days**: The itinerary is structured for 7 days, matching the query and expectations.

Despite its strengths, a few areas could be improved:
- Some meals lack specifics or are marked as unavailable (e.g., breakfast on days 1 and 3), which might raise eyebrows in the "not absent" check.
- Each day's meal and attraction should ideally not repeat in kind and location consecutively for best practice.

Overall, the example serves well to cover the evaluation functions, given its comprehensive nature, but there are minor lapses regarding repeated items and the handling of missing meal information.

Thus, I would assign a score of 85. It demonstrates a very good understanding of the constraints but leaves some room for enhancement.
