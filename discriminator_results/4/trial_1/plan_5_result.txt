The provided example shows a well-structured travel plan that adheres to several constraints mentioned in the evaluation script. Here’s a breakdown of how it addresses the commonsense constraints:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The example outlines a clear route from Las Vegas to Denver and back, which satisfies the definition of a reasonable visiting city. The first day begins in Las Vegas and ends in Denver, the second day stays in Denver, and the third day has a direct journey back to Las Vegas.

2. **Valid Restaurants and Meals**: Each day's meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) are included, with some meals specified and some left as "-", which is acceptable based on the constraints. For example, the first day has no breakfast or lunch, aligning with the travel plan's format.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions listed for Day 2 in Denver seem reasonable and are relevant to the city, which again fits the commonsense expectations of a travel plan.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodations listed for all days are consistent and adhere to the “minimum nights” rule. The fact that it stays at the same accommodation in Denver for both Day 1 and Day 2 also adheres to the common-sense rule of not frequently changing lodgings without necessity.

5. **Transport Validation**: Reference to self-driving transportation on the first and last day is well-structured, and the breakdown of costs related to it appears sensible, fitting within the budget outlined by the user.

6. **Valid Information**: The coordination of all meals, accommodations, transport, and attractions are effectively addressed, ensuring that the plan meets the user's budget and timeframe.

7. **Not Absent**: All necessary information is provided for each day, ensuring that no crucial elements are missing.

Despite its strengths, there are areas where clarity could be improved, particularly in stating how the budget limits are adhered to more explicitly and giving context on meal choices.

Overall, the example sufficiently covers the necessary constraints listed in the evaluation script. The travel plan is comprehensive, well-structured, and meets several commonsense evaluations.

Given this assessment, I would score this example at **85**, as it manages to cover the essential constraints with minor areas for improvement.
