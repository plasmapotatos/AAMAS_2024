The provided example offers a comprehensive travel plan that clearly outlines transportation, dining options, and accommodations across a 7-day itinerary for a specific trip. It includes specific details about transportation types, daily activities, meals, and costs, which are essential for assessing the common sense constraints outlined in the evaluation script.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The plan covers a closed-loop travel, starting from St. Louis and ending back in St. Louis, ensuring clarity on the sequence of cities visited (San Diego, San Francisco, Long Beach).
  
2. **Validation of Restaurants**: The example incorporates diverse dining options, which specifically conform to the request for American and Chinese cuisines, demonstrating clear adherence to this constraint.

3. **Attractions Planning**: Daily attractions reflect valid choices in each city and are varied, encouraging exploration of different locales without redundancy.

4. **Accommodation Rules**: The accommodations provided adhere to minimum night requirements, which are vital for ensuring validity in the trip's lodging aspects.

5. **Transportation**: The plan includes various transportation methods (flights, taxis) alongside costs and relevant details about flights (departure times, arrival times), which align with expectations for travel itineraries.

6. **Absence of Required Information**: The plan generally fulfills the requirement for sufficient details on meals, accommodations, and attractions. Each day is well-detailed, although day 1 and day 7 are less informative regarding meals, particularly for breakfast and dinner.

7. **Validity of Information in Current City**: The example effectively reflects on each day's activities, ensuring that all meals and attractions are local to the current cities being visited.

8. **Cuisines Represented**: It thoroughly fulfills dietary preferences stated in the query with featured restaurants serving American and Chinese cuisines.

Based on these points, the example provides rich context, illustration of constraints being satisfied, and clear adherence to the travel plan construction guidelines. However, due to minimal touch points on meals in certain days, it could be deemed not perfectly exhaustive.

Therefore, I would assign this example a score of 88, as it is mostly comprehensive but slightly lacking in details around some meals.

<output>88</output>
