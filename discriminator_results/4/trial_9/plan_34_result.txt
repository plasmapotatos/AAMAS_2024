The given example of a travel plan is quite informative and covers several aspects that the evaluation script presumably checks for. Analyzing this travel plan according to the constraints outlined in the script leads us to identify how well it adheres to commonsense reasoning.

1. **City Sequence**: The travel plan indicates a proper city sequence, starting from Provo to Phoenix, and then back from Phoenix to Provo, thus fulfilling the requirement of a closed trip.

2. **Transportation**: The transportation details are specified for the first and last days. It correctly identifies the mode of transport as "Self-driving", which matches the script's check for valid transportation options.

3. **Meals**: The meals are clearly delineated, with restaurants providing breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the respective days. They also ensure variety in cuisines, which aligns with the user's preferences.

4. **Attractions and Accommodation**: Attractions in Phoenix and details about the accommodation (including pet-friendly options) are provided. The accommodation also obeys the minimum night requirement set out in the query.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: A thorough total cost breakdown for each day is given, which allows validation against budget constraints outlined in the query.

6. **Common Sense Constraints**: The travel plan reflects common sense regarding preparation for travel (consideration of pets, variety in food options, budget adherence) which would likely satisfy the evaluators of the metric script.

Overall, the example does a decent job of following the guidelines laid out in the script, covering the essential components needed for a successful travel plan. However, there are slight shortcomings: for example, no transportation details are provided for the second day, and it would be beneficial if all restaurant options explicitly stated they were valid for the city indicated. 

Given these strengths and minor weaknesses, I would rate this example as an 85. It extensively covers the proper structure needed for evaluation but leaves a small area for improvement in detail.
