The provided travel planning example is relatively comprehensive, but it does have some areas that could lead to improvement when considering the evaluations specified in the evaluation script.

### Reasoning:
1. **City Validation**: The example does correctly start the journey in San Jose and ends in San Jose, fulfilling the requirement for a valid round trip (although the last day departure from Idaho Falls to a different city could potentially be flagged).

2. **Restaurant and Cuisine Choices**: The example includes multiple meals with specified restaurants covering Indian and French cuisines. This fulfills the meal requirements and adheres to culinary preferences stated in the prompt.

3. **Attractions**: Each day has a list of attractions which appear to include several popular spots in Idaho, adding to the viability of the travel plan. However, more detail on the attractions could add to its clarity as to why they were selected.

4. **Transportation**: The transportation method is specified for certain days, including flight and taxi, but more variety or details on transportation options (like whether it aligns with cost expectations) might be beneficial.

5. **Accommodation Validity**: The minimum nights for accommodation are included but could check for alignments with typical lodging expectations, as hitting the minimum does not always mean suitability for a group of seven.

6. **Cost Breakdown**: Cost calculations are provided, however, ensuring that they match the specifications in a detailed way can be helpful. For example, showing how each cost contributes to the total cost breakdown distinctively per day may enhance clarity.

7. **Overall Coherence**: The plan presents a coherent itinerary, but minor edits or additions to further clarify transportation details, add more variety to meal options, and more depth on attractions might significantly enhance the example.

Given these points of analysis, the example does fairly well in covering most of the commonsense constraints from the evaluation script but leaves some valuable insights on transportation, accommodation, and attractions unexplored.

**Score**: 75 / 100 

**Confidence**: The score suggests the example is substantially thorough but not perfect, acknowledging room for improvement in transportation and accommodation clarity.
