To evaluate the provided travel planning example and its effectiveness in meeting the benchmarks set by the commonsense constraint evaluation script, we will analyze several critical aspects detailed in the evaluation functions.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The plan outlines a clear start and end city along with a sequence of visits, adhering to the requirement for a reasonable visiting city structure.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The plan includes defined restaurants for each day, ensuring no duplicates are listed for meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

3. **Valid Accommodations**: The accommodation details align with the query conditions regarding preferences for private rooms and pet-friendly places. The minimum night stay is specified correctly.

4. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions listed correspond aptly to the city where the traveler is located, which is essential for validating attractions based on city context.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The details of self-driving transportation properly integrate the first and last day's travel, capturing the routes accurately.

6. **Information in Current City**: Each day's information in the travel plan ties back to the relevant city, ensuring that meals and attractions are valid for the specific locations stated in the current city.

7. **Not Absent**: The trip provides comprehensive information across all critical areas (transportation, meals, attractions, accommodations), thus not being vague or incomplete.

Overall, the example provided successfully meets the metrics set forth by the evaluation script, showcasing realism and practicality in a travel planning context. 

However, there is an area for improvement:
- On Day 3, only breakfast is specified, and there's a lack of lunch and dinner, which may not strictly align with the requirement for meals on each day, slightly diminishing completeness.

Taking all considerations into account, I would assign a score of **90** for the example's effectiveness, since it covers nearly all evaluation aspects while still having room for improvement in detailing meals.
