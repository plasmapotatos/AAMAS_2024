The provided example includes a detailed travel itinerary with multiple components that address various aspects of travel planning, which is crucial for maximizing effectiveness based on the commonsense constraint metrics. It covers the requirements for transportation, accommodation, meals, and attractions across a multi-day trip. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary initiates from a specified origin and returns to that point, including a visit to two cities in Idaho, fulfilling the query requirements.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Several unique restaurants are mentioned for each day, avoiding any duplicates and adhering to the specified cuisine preferences (Indian and French).

3. **Valid Attractions**: Multiple attractions specific to the cities visited are listed, enhancing the travel experience.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: Each day includes accommodations that comply with any stated restrictions, including minimum nights and occupancy limits.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The use of flight and taxi transportation is included, along with costs and durations. 

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: The meal choices, transportation, and attractions are appropriately linked to the respective cities visited each day.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The chosen accommodations and restaurants seem to align with real-world establishments, suggesting a plausible scenario.

8. **Not Absent**: The itinerary clearly provides all necessary details for each day without any omissions.

Overall, the provided example comprehensively addresses the evaluation functions present in the evaluation script and does so in a coherent and linked manner, meeting the constraints effectively.

Given the above analysis, I would rate the example:
