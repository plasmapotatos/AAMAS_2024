The provided example for travel planning as a prompt offers a structured travel plan that encompasses crucial aspects necessary for evaluation according to the specified criteria. Here is a breakdown of how well the example covers the evaluation functions:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The trip starts and ends in different cities, and the flow of cities is clear and follows the rules set in the evaluation.
2. **Valid Restaurants**: Meals are provided with the specified restaurants for each day, and there are no repeated restaurants.
3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions are specified for the stay in Rockford, which are different and valid.
4. **Valid Accommodation**: Accommodation options are clearly listed for each day, including the necessary details like cost and minimum nights.
5. **Valid Transportation**: The use of flights is correctly specified with valid flight numbers and costs.
6. **Information in Current City**: For each day, the current city is tracked and related activities are accounted for properly.

All necessary details are addressed, ensuring a comprehensive travel plan. However, there are minor areas that could be improved, such as ensuring the consistency in the accommodation for the last day which states “-” (implies no accommodation) however before that continuity is maintained. 

Considering the thoroughness and clarity of the example against the evaluation functions, I would score this example highly due to its informative nature and adherence to the constraints, but I would suggest that refining the last day's accommodation details could further solidify it. 

Final score: 
<output>90</output>
