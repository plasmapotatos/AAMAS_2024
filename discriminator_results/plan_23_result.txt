To evaluate the provided travel itinerary example against the various constraints outlined in the evaluation script, I will analyze each element specified in the travel plan and how they conform to common sense constraints that would be typically expected for such travel arrangements.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The plan starts from San Jose, then travels to Boise and Idaho Falls in Idaho, as required by the query. The itinerary logically concludes with a return to San Jose, thus satisfying the "closed circle" requirement.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day of the itinerary includes meals with different restaurant options, without any repetitions. However, the validation should ensure that each restaurant location is valid per the city context. The provided cuisines also match the preferences specified in the query.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions listed for each day fit within the cities being visited. There is no repetition in attractions, supporting the itinerary's compliance with the expected experience.

4. **Valid Accommodations**: The accommodation is consistently listed for each city, though it involves a minimum weekend constraint. Everything appears to be legitimate including the specified costs.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Transportation is provided in a detailed format including flight numbers and types of transports, without any conflicting transport modes mentioned.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Every day's current city aligns with what is expected based on the transportation or itinerary progressions. Meals and attractions are relevant to said cities.

7. **Validity in Sandbox**: The flights, taxi services, and related transport choices check out as sensible options and are appropriately mentioned with cost estimates.

8. **Absence of Necessary Items**: The itinerary appears to satisfy all necessary items needed, matching the evaluation parameters, without any critical omissions.

9. **Valid Number of Cities Visited**: The count of unique cities visited adheres to the parameters set forth by the user prompt.

10. **Days Confirmation**: The total number of traveling days matches the itinerary and query provided by the user.

Overall, the travel plan demonstrates adherence to the commonsense evaluation constraints laid out in the script. The itinerary is comprehensive, logical, and satisfies the user's requests effectively.

Given the thoroughness of the example, the relevancy of the content, and the validity against the evaluation functions, I would rate the provided travel itineraries as high quality and informative.
