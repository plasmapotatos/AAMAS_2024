The travel planning example provided covers various aspects crucial for evaluating the commonsense constraints in the travel planning evaluation script. Upon analyzing the travel plan against the evaluation functions, here is the breakdown:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The plan includes a clear route from the starting city (San Jose) through two Idaho cities (Boise and Idaho Falls) and returns to San Jose at the end, thus forming a closed loop.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Multiple restaurants are mentioned for various meals each day, thus providing enough data to verify uniqueness and presence.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions for each city are listed, ensuring that the requirements for attractions are satisfied for each day.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The plan specifies accommodations with details about costs and maximum occupancy, including minimum nights required for stays, which fulfills the validation checks.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Transportation means are clearly defined, including flights and taxis, providing enough context to evaluate the distances and costs.

6. **Information in Current City**: Each day mentions transportation, meals, and attractions, while also ensuring that meals and attractions relate to the current city.

7. **Validity in Sandbox**: The detailed transportation information (like flight numbers) and accommodations allow for checks against the sandbox requirements, ensuring compliance with structural elements.

8. **Total Days Validity**: The plan spans exactly the number of days requested with formats that appropriately align with the requirements.

9. **Not Absent Checks**: All necessary meal information, transportation, attractions, and accommodations are properly represented, minimizing absence.

Overall, the example effectively covers all necessary criteria for a reasonable and well-structured travel plan. That said, it does involve some complexity, such as ensuring all restaurant and attraction names are validated properly (which may not be directly verifiable without external databases present in the script).

Given the coverage and detail provided in the example, it can be rated positively but not perfectly due to the potential for specifics to be questioned (for example, the specific flight number's validity).

Thus, I would rate this example at **85** out of 100, as it demonstrates strong adherence to the evaluation criteria while retaining some areas that could be scrutinized.
