First, let's analyze the provided example against the evaluation functions defined in the script:

1. **is_reasonable_visiting_city**: The example mentions the starting point and covers transitions between the cities of Seattle, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, confirming that the cities visited are reasonable.

2. **is_valid_restaurants**: Each day lists specific restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, providing variety and ensuring they are not repeated. The details include specific costs and cuisines, satisfying this requirement.

3. **is_valid_attractions**: Each day details attractions that are unique to the respective city, and none are repeated, fulfilling this condition as well.

4. **is_valid_accommodation**: The accommodations specified for each city are detailed with costs, occupancy limits, house rules, and minimum stay requirements, which match correctly to the stated constraints. 

5. **is_valid_transportation**: Transportation details are present for the first three days via flights, and a clear distinction is made that the travelers will not be driving themselves. This aligns with the requirements.

6. **is_valid_information_in_current_city**: Each day's "current city" is supported by appropriate meals, attractions, and accommodations, indicating a valid reference to the cities' amenities. 

7. **is_valid_information_in_sandbox**: The example includes valid flight numbers, which can be cross-checked against existing data—this aspect appears sound.

8. **is_not_absent**: All required information for each day is provided, meeting the functional dependency without missing any meals, attractions, or types of accommodation.

Given this thoroughness, the example covers all of the evaluation functions well. However, there might be slight potential for improvements, such as ensuring that each meal's location is always linked to the day's current city and that transportation expenses are transparent across all days.

In conclusion, while the example is strong, there are minor points that can be enhanced. Therefore, I rate it a score of 85 as it successfully meets the commonsense constraints of the evaluation script, but there’s room for additional clarity and cross-referencing.
