To evaluate the provided travel plan example against the commonsense constraints laid out in the evaluation script, we need to ensure that it effectively encompasses the requirements detailed within the functions defined in the script. Here are the aspects we should consider:

1. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The travel plan outlines a clear starting point and transition between valid cities (St. Louis, San Diego, San Francisco, Long Beach) that correspond to the query.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day includes meals at specific restaurants, with a noted emphasis on the chosen cuisines—American and Chinese—which appear within the meal examples.

3. **Valid Accommodations**: Multiple mentions of accommodations corresponding to the cities are provided along with costs and occupancy details.

4. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions listed can plausibly exist in the outlined cities and fit the context of a travel itinerary.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Modes of transportation are clearly outlined for travel between cities, including flight numbers meeting expectations.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each segment reflects choices that are plausible within the context of each city (i.e., meals, attractions, accommodations).

7. **Validation of all Aspects**: The plan also showcases versatility in meal preferences, incorporates proper budgeting, and adheres to a structured timeline of days.

Further considerations:
- The number of cities and meals aligns with the query about dining preferences and the required number of visiting cities.
- The transportation method is varied and reflects common travel practices (flights, taxis).

Despite an overall analytical affirmation, there are some minor concerns:
- Even though the travel distance and costs seem reasonable for selected flights and taxi rides, a clearer reference to distance or mode specifications (especially for the taxi ride) would enhance accuracy.
- There’s lack of exact distance or travel duration mentioned for some inter-city travels, which may not perfectly align with the evaluation constraints regarding distances.

Taking into account these points and the presence of all essential elements required by the evaluation script, I assign the score of 90. The example is robust but could have been improved with some more explicit transportation distance metrics or time durations.
