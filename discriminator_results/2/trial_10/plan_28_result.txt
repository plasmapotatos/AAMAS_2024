### Reasoning

The provided example presents a detailed travel plan meeting several commonsense constraints defined in the evaluation script. Here's an analysis of how well it addresses each of these constraints: 

1. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The plan covers travel from St. Louis to three distinct cities in California (San Diego, San Francisco, Long Beach), and it returns to St. Louis, which establishes a reasonable visiting city pattern.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Multiple dining options are included across different days, each with specific cuisines, including the American and Chinese preferences specified in the prompt.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Each city features attractions listed for the days spent there, ensuring variety and interest, thus conforming to the need for valid attractions.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodations do not repeat unnecessarily, showcase minimum night stays where applicable, and have been well-defined with costs.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Transportation details are clearly laid out for travel between cities, including flight details and the use of taxis, ensuring that all movements are reasonably explained.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day's plan validates the details around food, attractions, transportation, and accommodation options that correlate well with the cities visited.

7. **Sandbox Information Validity**: Each accommodation, restaurant, and attraction aligns with expected norms of what is available (as per dataset info implied), indicating sensible placements.

8. **Non-Absence of Necessary Information**: The travel plan covers each day's activities with all necessary components specified and appropriate contextual information provided.

9. **Logical Daily Sequence and Validations**: The trip logically progresses and adheres to the constraints on transport types and purposes (e.g., avoiding contradictions in transportation means).

The overall detailed layout, combined with the specific attention to the constraints required for effective evaluation, signifies a high validity of the example travel plan. The coverage across evaluations ensures that this example is comprehensive.

### Score
Given the thoroughness and the critical alignment with all required evaluation criteria, I would assign a score of 95%. This acknowledges a near-optimal example while allowing slight room for potential refinements.
