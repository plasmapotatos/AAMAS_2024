### Reasoning:

The provided travel planning example encompasses a variety of essential aspects that will be evaluated by the commonsense constraint evaluation script in terms of:

1. **Transport Options**: The plan clearly states the transportation modes, including self-driving from various cities and clarifying there are no flights utilized. It also provides relevant transport information for each leg of the trip, which is essential for validating transportation criteria.

2. **City Sequence**: Starting in Denver and moving through Texas before returning ensures the journey is closed, as required. Additionally, it ensures cities appear consecutively within the context of the travel days.

3. **Accommodations**: The accommodations provided follow the requirement of allowing smoking, catering to the user's needs. The number of nights requirements are adhered to, as seen in the repeated mention of “minimum nights” adhered to in different stays.

4. **Dining Options**: Meals are provided for each day, showcasing a range of cuisines, fulfilling dietary preferences, and ensuring there are no repeats in restaurant choices within the context of each day.

5. **Attractions**: Each day includes various attractions that are clearly defined and listed, further contributing to the engagement of activities across the travel itinerary. 

6. **Cost Calculation and Budgeting**: The provided information includes diligent cost calculations that reflect accurate budgeting aligned with the question's constraints, demonstrating a complete financial overview.

7. **Daily Configuration**: Each day is arranged logically with all necessary details filled, ensuring no components are absent (e.g., meals, transportation, attractions, and accommodations). 

8. **Consistency in City Names**: There's a clear adherence to where travel is planned, and continuity in referring to cities and points of interest is maintained through the example.

In summary, the example provided utilizes best practices in travel planning, covering nearly all potential evaluation points within the provided evaluation functions. However, it lacks explicit checks against a list of valid city names, which could improve its adherence to the evaluation criteria.

### Score:
Given the comprehensive nature of the example, it effectively aligns with a high criterion for commonsense travel planning, achieving a near-optimal evaluation with minor room for improvement. Therefore, I would score it:
