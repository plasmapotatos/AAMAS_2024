To evaluate the effectiveness of the provided example in covering the commonsense constraints defined by the evaluation script, I will analyze several key elements:

1. **Travel Constraints and Validity**: The query specifies dropping from San Jose and visiting two cities in Idaho over five days, which aligns well with the provided itinerary. The itinerary's structure should maintain a reasonable flow of traveling and city sequences.

2. **Transportation Details**: The itinerary includes both specified modes of transportation (flights and taxis) as well as their costs. The flight details include a flight number, which adds a layer of specificity and validity. The transportations for both days, where applicable, are accounted for, and the modes used are reasonable.

3. **Meals and Restaurants**: The provided itinerary lists meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for each day and describes the restaurants along with their associated cuisines. The description matches the userâ€™s request for Indian and French cuisine, showing that the plan adheres to preferences and dietary constraints.

4. **Accommodations**: The example specifies accommodations for each day, identifying the rental type, costs, and limitations (like maximum occupancy and house rules). The minimum nights for the accommodations correspond to common expectations.

5. **Attractions**: Daily attractions are listed, maintaining a tourist-friendly view for each selected destination, ensuring they are relevant.

6. **Completeness**: Each day is accounted for clearly, and calculations for costs and the overall journey are comprehensively presented. The total cost calculation seems valid, as it adjusts for the number of people and details expenses accordingly.

7. **Error Checking**: From the evaluations defined in the script, it captures possible errors, such as transportation, accommodation validity, city sequence, meals, and attractions. Here, each category appears valid.

Given these criteria, the example comprehensively meets the parameters set forth by the evaluation script. It consistently provides adequate details to verify user-specific requirements while properly managing the constraints it needs to satisfy.

I would assign a score of 95. It could have potentially included more details about the specific restaurants matching Indian and French cuisine but overall was very thorough and would likely perform well against the evaluation script.
