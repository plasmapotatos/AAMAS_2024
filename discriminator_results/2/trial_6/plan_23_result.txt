To evaluate the provided example against the commonsense constraint metrics outlined in the evaluation script, let's analyze the travel plan in detail:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary starts from the specified origin (San Jose) and ends at the same city, creating a closed loop. Boise and Idaho Falls are valid locations in Idaho, satisfying this constraint.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The meals listed for each day do not repeat the same restaurant during breakfast, lunch, or dinner across the days. Various cuisines are included, consistent with the user’s request for Indian and French options.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Each day includes attractions relevant to the city's location. Attractions are not repeated, fulfilling the uniqueness criteria.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: Accommodation entries are present for most days and meet the requirement of not exceeding the maximum occupancy and minimum night stay rules outlined in the travel plan.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The transportation options are specified correctly, including flights and taxis, which align with the travel dates. Transportation choices are consistent with the travel between cities.

6. **Valid Information in the Current City**: Each day’s meals and attractions relate directly to the current city indicated on that day, ensuring that there's no mismatch.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The example adheres to various constraints related to the meals, transportation, and the attractions concerning the current city.

8. **Not Absent**: For each day, there is a good balance between the provided details about transportation, meals, attractions, and accommodations, ensuring that no vital information is neglected.

9. **Valid Accommodation**: Properly specified accommodations that adhere to listing rules are present for most of the stay.

10. **Visiting City Number**: The cities visited (Boise and Idaho Falls) align with the provided limit of 2 cities.

11. **Valid Days**: The total days and specific information for each day are all present and accounted for, further supporting an evaluation that finds the itinerary thorough.

Overall, the example addresses nearly all requirements posited by the evaluation script. However, there may be minor issues regarding the total number of accommodations listed. The last day shows no accommodation, which might go against the common sense that travelers typically need accommodation at their travel endpoint.

Thus, based on all these points, the score reflects a very high level of completeness and correctness but also acknowledges the slight oversight regarding accommodation on the last day. Therefore, I would give this example a score of 95.
