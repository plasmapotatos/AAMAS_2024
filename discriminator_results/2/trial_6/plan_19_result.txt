To evaluate the effectiveness of the example provided based on the constraints outlined in the evaluation script, we need to analyze it with respect to how well it demonstrates the different validity checks required by the travel planning agent. The evaluation script evaluates a variety of constraints, including:

1. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The travel plan starts and ends at the specified cities and follows a logical journey.
2. **Valid Restaurants**: The restaurants mentioned throughout the travel plan seem to comply with expected data and are not repeated inappropriately.
3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions listed appear to be relevant to the cities mentioned for the specified days.
4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodations provided should comply with the constraints related to minimum nights and maximum occupancy.
5. **Valid Transportation**: Transportation options should be relevant for the cities mentioned and not contradictory (e.g., no conflicting transportation modes).
6. **Valid Information in Current City**: The accommodations, meals, and attractions should relate to the current city.
7. **Information in Sandbox Validation**: The entries should validate against a sandbox of possible options (e.g., actual accommodations, restaurants that meet criteria).
8. **Not Absent Requirement**: The plan must not be missing critical information (e.g., transportation, meals, current city).

Let's break down the example:

- **Current City Transitions**: The plan shows accurate transitions between cities: departing from Washington to Orlando, staying in Orlando, and returning to Washington. 
- **Transportation**: The plan mentions transportation that makes sense contextually, specifically noting self-driving for the first and third days.
- **Meals**: It provides sufficient meal information, with all slots filled apart from Day 1 where there is a "no breakfast" entry. 
- **Attractions and Accommodation**: Attractions are relevant to the days spent in the respective cities, and accommodation follows the rules stated around costs and minimum occupancy requirements.

The provided travel plan currently satisfies the major constraints (cities visited, transportation, entries for meals, accommodation). 

However, it could improve in a few key areas:
- **Diversity of Meals**: It could feature more variety in breakfast options across all days, particularly on Day 1.
- **Attractions**: Attractions could be more richly detailed or expanded upon, offering a broader range of activities to ensure they cover various interests.
- **Cost Breakdown**: While total costs are provided, some more details on how each cost figure leads up to the total could enhance clarity and trust in the provided figure.

Given this analysis, I would assign an overall score that reflects its strengths while also considering the areas where it could improve for fuller coverage of all constraints and optimal user experience.

Thus, I would rate the score as follows:
<output>85</output>
