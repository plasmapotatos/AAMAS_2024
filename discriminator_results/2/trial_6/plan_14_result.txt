The given example represents a comprehensive travel plan and seems to address many components required for a thorough validation against the commonsense constraints listed in the evaluation script. 

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The trip logically starts in Daytona Beach and includes visits to three different cities in Texas, satisfying both logical flow and number of distinct cities.
  
2. **Valid Restaurants**: The plan includes various dining options for each day, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, indicating diversity and adherence to local restaurant choices.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The inclusion of multiple attractions specific to each city supports compliance with the constraints and enhances the travel experience.

4. **Valid Transportation**: The transportation methods (mostly self-driving) and detailed travel times seem appropriate for the distances covered.

5. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day's itinerary is specific and related to the appropriate city, preventing any ambiguity about where the user is.

6. **Accommodation**: Every day specifies accommodation and meets the minimum nights requirement stated in the plan, reinforcing compliance with both logic and constraints. 

7. **Days Validation**: The plan accurately reflects the total number of days intended (7), which matches the user's query.

8. **Absence Check**: Meals, transportation, and accommodations are properly filled out or appropriately marked as "-" when not applicable, ensuring no critical information is omitted.

9. **Total Cost Calculation**: The plan includes a computation of total costs per day, which is a nice feature that adds transparency and clarity.

While the solution covers many aspects well, a few areas could still be improved:
- Some days, particularly the ones without specified meals (like breakfast on Days 1, 3, and 7), could benefit from back-up choices or alternatives to suggest flexibility.
- Some attractions are not specified for every day, which might raise concerns about daily engagement or activity balance on certain days.
- The query implies traveling on a budget; however, the financial constraints are not explicitly linked with each daily total cost in a budgetary overview. 

Overall, the example demonstrates thoroughness, indeed addressing the majority of the validation points in the evaluation script. Therefore, I would rate this example 85, recognizing the high level of detail and logic it encompasses while also acknowledging room for slight improvement.
