To determine the effectiveness of the provided example in complying with the commonsense constraints detailed in the evaluation script, we need to analyze how comprehensively the travel plan addresses the evaluation criteria.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary observes the required flow of cities, starting from San Jose, moving to Boise, then Idaho Falls, and back to San Jose. It respects the circular trip requirement.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The meals are planned in both cities (Boise and Idaho Falls) with distinct lunch, dinner, and breakfast options for multiple days, fulfilling the number of different cuisines requested.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Each day includes a list of attractions, which are varied and relevant to the cities listed in the daily itinerary.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodation details are provided for each city, with distinct options that meet minimum stay requirements.

5. **Valid Transportation**: There is a logical progression of transport modes; flights are used for the origin and return, and local transport (taxi) for longer distances in Idaho, each with verified costs.

6. **Validity of Information in Current Cities**: The provided transport, accommodation, meals, and attractions all correlate accurately with the respective cities and are clearly identified, maintaining coherence between planned activities and locations.

7. **Is Not Absent**: The plan does not lack in critical information; it addresses transportation, meals, accommodations, and attractions for all stated days, with sufficient detail for verification.

Thus, the example effectively illustrates a travel plan that meets common sense constraints across the board. It provides a thorough breakdown of all requested elements, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of the constraints as evaluated by the script.

Considering these points, the score for this example in terms of covering all evaluation functions comprehensively is quite high. The lack of any critical mistakes or omissions, as well as the fulfillment of constraints regarding cities, transport, meals, and activities, leads us to assign a score of 95.
