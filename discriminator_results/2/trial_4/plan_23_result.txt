To evaluate the provided travel planning example relative to the commonsense constraints outlined in the evaluation script, we must assess its comprehensiveness and adherence to the various constraints. 

### Reasoning:

1. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The itinerary includes a clear route from San Jose to two cities (Boise and Idaho Falls), which fits the constraint of traveling through the specified cities.

2. **Transportation**: Each day's transportation method is clearly listed, including relevant details such as cost, duration, and type (flight or taxi). The transportation choices align with the specified itinerary and appear reasonable.

3. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day has non-repeating meal options across breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which fulfills the requirement of unique dining experiences. The cuisines mentioned reflect the travelers' interests (Indian and French).

4. **Valid Attractions**: The itinerary includes attractions that are unique to the cities being visited, further validating the travel plan.

5. **Valid Accommodations**: Accommodation options are provided with details on costs, occupancy, and house rules. The minimum nights required for accommodations are also respected.

6. **City Information**: The cities included in the trip are valid and relate to their state (Idaho), and the sequence of cities is correct, adhering to the expected flow of a round-trip journey.

7. **Constraining Information**: The total cost is calculated properly with clear breakdowns per day and across the entire trip, ensuring the budget constraint is met.

8. **Absence Checks**: Each day is filled with appropriate information about transportation, accommodations, meals, and attractions, minimizing any absence of required details.

9. **Cuisine Specification**: The prompt's cuisine preferences (Indian and French) are incorporated throughout the plan, indicating adherence to dietary interests.

Overall, the example is comprehensive, covering all constraints listed in the evaluation script accordingly. However, certain minor areas could be improved, such as providing justifications for selected restaurants and attractions based on availability or local reviews. Additionally, the cost breakdown could include additional details about potential penalties or discounts if applicable.

Considering all these factors, I would rate this example quite highly for fulfilling the constraints while leaving room for slight improvement.
