To evaluate the example provided for its effectiveness in eliciting a travel plan that satisfies commonsense constraints, we need to analyze it against the evaluation script's criteria. 

1. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The prompt includes the journey from Washington to Orlando and back, which is well-defined. The travel plan respects this by listing the specific cities correctly at the beginning and end of each day, ensuring a closed trip.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The example provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner options for each day (except Day 1 dinner and Day 3), which is generally appropriate. However, the absence of dinner on Day 1 and 3 could be considered a limitation in terms of fulfilling all possible meal requirements.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions are included for Day 2, which is good. The only note is that no attractions are specified for Day 1 or Day 3, which could be seen as a shortcoming if attractions are expected on all days.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: Accommodation is specified for Days 1 and 2 but not for Day 3, which raises questions about potential lodging upon returning to Washington.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The transportation for Days 1 and 3 is explicitly mentioned as self-driving, which is appropriate. For Day 2, transportation is not specified, but this could work since they are staying in the same city. However, it could lead to interpretational issues regarding moving within Orlando.

6. **Information in Current City**: The travel plan mentions the current city for each day, providing adequate information on where the activities will take place.

7. **Not Absent**: The plan generally meets the requirement of providing key information on each day, but with missing elements (like some dinners or attractions), it might not meet the stringent requirement of having all info present.

8. **Overall Cost Assessment**: The costing breakdown is very clear, and total cost calculations are provided which adhere to the budget constraints set forth in the prompt.

Given the comprehensive assessment, the example covers most, but not all, constraints optimally. The main limitations are the missing meals and attractions on specific days, which detracts from a perfect evaluation score. Therefore, we assign a final score reflecting these observations.
