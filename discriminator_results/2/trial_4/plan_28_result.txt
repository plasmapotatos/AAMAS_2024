To determine the effectiveness of the example provided in meeting the requirements of the commonsense constraint evaluation script, we need to analyze it against the various validation criteria outlined in the script.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The travel plan clearly states the primary cities visited (San Diego and San Francisco) during the trip, and these cities adhere to the geographical context since they are all located in California, as specified in the prompt.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The example includes a variety of restaurants for meals on each day, with a clear focus on representing diverse cuisines such as American and Chinese. There is also no repetition of restaurant names, which aligns with the requirement.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions are mentioned for each city, indicating planned activities that enrich the travel experience without any overlaps, which meets the validation criteria.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodations for each day contain details such as cost, location, and minimum night requirements, which seem coherent and realistic.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The travel plan includes qualifications for the modes of transportation, specifying a mix of flights and taxis, with corresponding costs and travel times, thus corresponding to the input itinerary and staying within logical expectations.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day's plan reflects logical city sequences (from-to relationships) and validates meals and transportation relating back to the correct locations.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The entries for transportation and accommodations are sufficiently detailed and seem plausible, which suggests that the evaluation script should find the examples valid when calling the respective functions.

8. **Not Absent**: All required information (accommodation, attractions, meals, transportation) is present without being absent.

9. **Valid City Sequence**: The example follows a circular route by returning to St. Louis at the end of the trip.

Overall, the example displays a comprehensive approach that adheres closely to the commonsense constraints likely evaluated in the script. It covers all evaluation functions adequately without ambiguity or lack of detail. 

**Rating**: Given the thorough representation of the various aspects required by the evaluation script, and the absence of any significant issues evident in the trip planning, the score provided can be high.
