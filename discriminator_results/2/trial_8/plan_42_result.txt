The travel itinerary provided in the example covers many aspects necessary for a thorough evaluation by the commonsense constraint metric. Here are the points to consider:

1. **Reasonableness of Visiting Cities**: The cities visited are Texas cities, and the journey starts and ends in Seattle, which aligns with the user’s wishes and is reasonable.
   
2. **Accommodations**: The example specifies accommodations that allow parties, which is a requirement, and details like maximum occupancy and minimum nights are provided to ensure validation against constraints.

3. **Transportation**: The use of flight transportation is clearly explained with specific flight numbers, which helps validate transportation details against expected inputs.

4. **Restaurants and Attractions**: There are validated meal options and attractions specified for several days; however, several days are without transportation and have no meals listed (marked as "-"), which could be seen as an absence of information.

5. **Financial Evaluation**: The budget calculation is clearly articulated, showing total costs per person in relation to daily expenses—a critical factor for commonsense evaluation.

6. **City Validation**: City names are correctly extracted and formatted, and the itinerary maintains a structure that facilitates the validation process against rules set in the commonsense constraints.

However, there are concerns regarding the empty entries for transportation and meals on certain days of the itinerary. This can be seen as a violation of the rule that requires some activities to be planned for each day. Although it is possible that the traveler deliberately chose to fill specific days minimally, the overall itinerary may suffer from "too much absence" of key details on certain days.

Overall, the example is robust in many areas, but issues with absent information (noted across certain days) prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

After considering these aspects, I would rate the example:
