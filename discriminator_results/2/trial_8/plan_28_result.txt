To evaluate the provided travel plan example against the evaluation functions listed in the script, we'll analyze multiple aspects of the plan to determine its comprehensiveness and adherence to the evaluated constraints.

1. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The plan starts in St. Louis and includes visits to several cities in California, which aligns with the query request. This appears to be reasonable.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day includes specific restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The cuisines specified in the query are represented, and there aren’t any repetitions in the active days, aligning well with the requirements.

3. **Valid Attractions**: There’s a notable effort to include attractions in each city visited. Each attraction seems well-organized and matches the respective cities, ensuring more validity.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: Each entry includes accommodations with noted costs and compliance with minimum night requirements, with clear descriptions for maximum occupancy and house rules provided.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Various modes of transportation are provided (flights, taxis) and align with the journey transitions on designated days.

6. **Current City Information Validation**: Each day's “current city” is linked to its transportation, whether it's self-driving or through a flight. Each meal corresponds to the city listed, and transportation is provided when necessary.

7. **Sandbox Validations**: There’s no mention of invalid flights, transportation, or missing elements in the sandbox according to the provided rules. Every meal and attraction reflects the associated city/cuisine well.

8. **Not Absent Check**: Each day has comprehensive entries covering meals, transportation, accommodation, and attractions, which is essential for ensuring completeness and adherence to guidelines.

9. **Visiting City Numbers**: The numbers align well with the original request, suggesting that the correct number of cities has been covered without violation of the journey's criteria.

10. **Valid Days**: Each day is accounted for, which reflects adequate handling of daily plans.

Overall, this travel plan encompasses numerous aspects of the constraints outlined in the travel plan evaluation script, establishing a well-rounded example for the travel planning agent.

Considering all points above, I would assign a score based on how well these constraints were met:
- **96**: The plan follows all outlined constraints comprehensively, with edible meal choices that reflect the initial query, valid and coherent transportation and accommodation arrangements, and a clear structure that facilitates reviewing and validating against the set criteria.

Thus, the output score is:
<output>96</output>
