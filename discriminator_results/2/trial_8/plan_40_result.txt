To evaluate whether the provided example effectively covers the commonsense constraints outlined in the evaluation script, we must scrutinize various aspects of the travel plan presented in the example.

1. **Validity of Cities Visited**: The itinerary specifies starting from Denver (valid) and moving to Amarillo and Lubbock in Texas, which are both legitimate cities. The conditions for a valid city sequence need to be respected, and in this case, they seem to be.

2. **Transportation Validity**: The example emphasizes the absence of flights and specifies "self-driving" as the mode of transport between cities. This adheres to the user prompt's requirements and aligns with transportation validation criteria.

3. **Accommodation Legitimacy**: The accommodations listed are described correctly with the necessary criteria (e.g., allows smoking) and within the restrictions regarding minimum stay. Furthermore, the calculations of costs and occupancy match the requirements laid out in the query.

4. **Dining Validity**: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner options are provided each day. They are not duplicated day to day and meet the dietary specifications of being varied and of the requested cuisines. These need to be validated against the restaurants available in the specific cities.

5. **Attractions Validity**: Attractions for each city are listed without repetition and seem to align with regional interests, which will likely conform with attraction validation parameters.

6. **Comprehensive Information**: Each day includes essential travel and meal information, ensuring there's no missing data. This should satisfy checks for the presence of valid information.

7. **Adherence to Days and Costs**: The query asks for a structured plan for 5 days, which the example outlines clearly. The total costs calculated per day and cumulatively align with the specified budget constraints, and the plan accounts for all needed details regarding transportation, meals, and attractions.

Based on these points, it appears that the example effectively covers the different constraints and requirements set out in the evaluation script. It also provides examples of all areas that the evaluation script assesses: cities, transportation, restaurants, attractions, accommodations, and total costs.

Overall, while the example is comprehensive and aligns well with evaluation requirements, its capacity to satisfy nuanced scenarios, such as several alternative routes, specific dietary restrictions beyond what is mentioned, and validation against various potential databases, could be enhanced. However, it significantly fulfills the essential aspects.

Given this analysis, I would assign a score of:
