To evaluate the example and its effectiveness in maximizing the commonsense constraint metrics as outlined in the evaluation script, we must consider various factors from the constraints set forth.

1. **Visiting City Information**: The query specifies visiting 3 distinct cities in Texas over 7 days, which is adhered to in the travel plan. The cities listed are clearly defined, and the path back to the origin is confirmed, showing a well-structured travel route.

2. **Transportation Validity**: The transportation details are provided and consistent throughout the days, with mentions of "self-driving" and side calculations of duration and cost. However, it is important to ensure that the transportation methods are suitable and not conflicting (like not mixing taxi with self-driving), which the plan addresses.

3. **Daily Activity Constraints**: Each day is coupled with information about meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and attractions. The plan includes indicators for food and attractions and ensures there are no identical restaurants across meals, thus satisfying the varying meal constraint.

4. **Accommodation Rules**: Information regarding accommodations is provided for every night, alongside compliance with minimum stay rules. This caters to both the accommodation validity and constraints surrounding the number of guests.

5. **Commonsense Reasonableness**: The overall plan follows a logical flow and provides validity checks regarding distance, duration, and associated costs given the user's parameters. There is also a calculation of total costs and a breakdown by day, ensuring complete transparency.

6. **Absence Check and Minimum Requirements**: The plan seems to mitigate the risk of omitted information, with provisions filled in for each day in accordance with the questions regarding meals, attractions, and accommodation.

7. **Cuisines**: Although the prompt does not specify cuisines, the plans include a variety of culinary options, which adheres to possible thematic preferences, fulfilling the extra dimension of dining variety.

Overall, the example is comprehensive, adheres to the constraints, and demonstrates how to create a travel plan that fits the description provided in the query. It sufficiently covers all evaluation functions while showing consideration of commonsense rules.

Given the thoroughness of the travel plan, how well it adheres to the commonsense constraints, and the sound structure of the provided information, I would assign a score of 90. It is informative and maximally adheres to the evaluation script's guidelines for such a scenario, with minor weaknesses in specific culinary details.
