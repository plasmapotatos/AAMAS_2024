To evaluate the travel planning example provided, we need to ensure that it covers the necessary aspects outlined in the commonsense constraint evaluation script. The following criteria should be addressed:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The travel plan starts and ends in the specified city (St. Louis), and all destinations align with the trip's theme of visiting California cities.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The example shows differentiated meal options for each day, with a variety of cuisines mentioned, confirming that it satisfies the dining preferences outlined in the query.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions unique to each city are provided, ensuring that visitors have options available in each location.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodation details for the nights spent in each location are given, including specific characteristics, maximum occupancy, and adherence to minimum nights required.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Different modes of transportation (flights and taxi) are specified, and these are linked to the corresponding travel between cities.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day's plan includes details about the city the travelers are in, the food they will be eating, and the attractions they will visit, ensuring relevant destinations and meals are correlated properly.

7. **Information in Sandbox**: Transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation details must be valid against the evaluation dataset (implied by including real-world elements like flight numbers and restaurant names).

8. **Not Absent Information**: All expected fields are populated for each day, presenting no gaps in the travel information provided.

Given that the example encompasses all these criteria, ensuring a coherent travel plan covering transportation, dining, attractions, city sequence, and accommodation, it successfully utilizes commonsense principles behind travel planning. Each day of the trip is well-defined and meets the user's needs, with a total cost that remains within the user's budget.

Considering the thoroughness and clarity of the provided travel plan while adhering to the constraints and commonsense rules evaluated by the script, the example merits a score of 95.
