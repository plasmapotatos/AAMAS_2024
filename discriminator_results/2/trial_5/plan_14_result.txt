To evaluate the example provided in the prompt, we need to analyze whether it effectively covers the various commonsense constraints outlined in the evaluation script. 

1. **Travel Plan Validity**: The travel plan should start and end in the same city (Daytona Beach in this case), which it does. This is consistent with the requirement that the trip should be a closed circle. 

2. **City Sequence**: The cities in the travel itinerary should be visited in a valid sequence, meaning they need to be rationally connected and no city appears more than once except for the starting/ending city. In this example, cities are visited logically.

3. **Transportation**: The plan consistently indicates the transportation method for each day. It checks consistency (e.g., not mixing transportation methods that would conflict). The plan specifies "Self-driving" correctly, which seems appropriate for the distances involved.

4. **Restaurant Choices**: The travel plan includes varied meal options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day, showing the kinds of restaurants appropriate for the cities being visited as per the required details. The absence of duplicates in restaurant choices supports the requirement.

5. **Attractions**: The attractions listed are unique for the cities visited, further validating the individual's itinerary during their travels. 

6. **Accommodation**: Each day has an accommodation entry, and repeat mentions are handled correctly according to minimum night requirements.

7. **Financials**: The travel plan includes the cost of transportation and accommodation, keeping the budget in mind while also detailing cumulative costs.

8. **Days and Activities**: The number of days is adhered to, and each entry represents a complete set of necessary travel details, fulfilling required meal info, accommodation, and attractions.

All these aspects confirm that the example provided in the prompt aligns well with the constraints and requirements set out in the evaluation script. 

However, there are some areas for improvement:
- The plan could specify more comprehensive meal details across each day (even if it includes "-" for meals not taken) to fully hit the "not absent" metrics.
- Greater context or rationale for choices could enhance clarity and further validate routes or environments (e.g., stating travel timings and distance confirmations for the self-driving segments).

Given the comprehensive coverage of the commonsense constraints in the evaluation script and the minor areas for improvement, I would rate the example's effectiveness at a solid 85.
