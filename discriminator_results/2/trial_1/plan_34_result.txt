**Reasoning:**

The provided travel plan example effectively covers various aspects needed to evaluate the commonsense constraints as outlined in the evaluation script. Here's how it addresses these constraints:

1. **Reasonable City Sequences**: The trip starts from Provo to Phoenix, then returns from Phoenix to Provo on Day 3, ensuring a closed trip. This validates the reasonable visiting cities criteria.
   
2. **Valid Restaurants**: A variety of dining options (with specific cuisines mentioned in the plan) provide context for validating restaurant choices, making it easy to assess the validity of the restaurants listed.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions listed for Day 2 show a reasonable expectation for tourist activities in Phoenix, conforming to commonsense expectations for that location.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodation includes rules regarding occupancy and terms, which can be easily validated against external data sets for proper verification.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The plan details transportation for all days, indicating self-driving, which is appropriate for the specified locations.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: The transmission of city-specific information (like the necessity of breakfast and dining options per day) indicates adherence to expectations of local culture and options available in those cities.

7. **Accurate Day Count**: The travel plan correctly lists 3 days, corresponding to the duration specified in the query.

8. **Non-Absence of Required Info**: The plan includes specified meals, attractions, accommodation, and transportation for each day, ensuring no required information is lacking.

The only potential downside is that the travel plan could specify more details about transportation (e.g., more about the route or vehicle information), and in Day 1, the breakfast option is missing, indicating a potential lack in the dining area details which can be crucial for evaluation. However, the specificity in cuisine and costs is helpful, making the overall evaluation robust.

Given the comprehensive nature of the example and its clarity in addressing the requirements outlined in the evaluation script, I would score this example as an **85** out of 100.
