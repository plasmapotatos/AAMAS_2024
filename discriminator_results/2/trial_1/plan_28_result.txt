To evaluate the example provided against the commonsense constraint evaluation script, we need to ensure that it meets the criteria defined in various specific checks. This involves validating features such as reasonable visiting cities, valid restaurant choices, accommodation adequacy, attractions, transportation modalities, and absence of information.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The travel plan begins in St. Louis, has a logical progression through several California cities, and concludes back at St. Louis. This follows a reasonable trajectory for a trip and matches the organization described in the prompt.
  
2. **City Sequence and Validity**: The plan includes consecutive travel between valid cities in California. Each travel leg is well-defined and cities are correctly looped back by the end, thus satisfying the logic of city visiting sequences.

3. **Restaurant Validity**: The plan includes dining at recognized restaurants with specified cuisines. Furthermore, multiple cuisines (American and Chinese) are addressed throughout, correlating with the user's preferences.

4. **Attractions**: Various attractions are noted, which could also reflect the interests of the travelers. The attractions mentioned align with each city visited and contribute to a rounded exploration of the area.

5. **Transportation Validity**: Different modes of transportation are identified clearly, including flights, taxis, and driving, while flight numbers and details are included for transparency and validation.

6. **Accommodation**: The accommodation details are thorough, including prices and minimum stay requirements, ensuring that the travelers' lodging needs are meticulously catered to across the journey.

7. **Comprehensiveness**: The plan comprises all days as requested, with corresponding activities for each, showing that no day is left blank concerning meals, transportation, or lodging.

8. **Cost Analysis**: A detailed cost breakdown for each day provides clarity and reflects the budget, assisting in ensuring financial feasibility.

9. **Cuisines Representation**: The specific request for American and Chinese cuisines is fulfilled throughout the dining plans, satisfying dietary preferences laid out initially.

Given the above checks, the example presents a comprehensive and logical travel plan that encapsulates the metrics defined in the evaluation script. It effectively covers the necessary aspects for each requirement stated in the evaluation functions.

Thus, I would rate this example highly on the commonsense constraint scale due to its clarity, adherence to prompts, and comprehensive nature.
