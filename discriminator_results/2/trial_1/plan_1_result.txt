Reasoning:

The provided travel plan example appears to cover a range of essential constraints that the evaluation script checks for. Here's how it aligns with the evaluation functions specified:

1. **is_reasonable_visiting_city**: The trip starts in St. Petersburg and returns there after visiting Rockford. It checks the sequence of cities and validates there are no logical inconsistencies. The plan clearly outlines the current cities for each day.

2. **is_valid_restaurants**: The meal options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are adequately specified for each day, and the plan does not repeat restaurant choices. This is helpful in validating this function.

3. **is_valid_attractions**: The plan includes attractions on multiple days, ensuring there are no duplicates, which fulfills this criterion.

4. **is_valid_accommodation**: Each day includes accommodation details with relevant information like cost, type, and restrictions. The checks on minimum nights are appropriately satisfied.

5. **is_valid_transportation**: The travel plan specifies flight details with flight numbers, departure, and arrival information, ensuring valid transportation is outlined for each transition.

6. **is_valid_information_in_current_city**: Each day's meals, attractions, and accommodation are correctly aligned with the current city, satisfying the condition for this evaluation.

7. **is_valid_information_in_sandbox**: The flight numbers given could be validated against a sandbox of flight data to evaluate if they are accurate, meeting the sandbox check.

8. **is_not_absent**: The plan accounts for each day, ensuring that all necessary information (transportation, accommodation, meals) is filled out for a thorough evaluation.

In summary, the example plan provided has covered all required evaluation functions robustly, showcasing logical consistency, detailed data inclusion, and no repetition issues. However, while it is a comprehensive example, a few points could have been better extricated, such as the inclusion of more varied transportation means and enhanced restaurant variety.

Taking these considerations into account, I would score this example as follows:
