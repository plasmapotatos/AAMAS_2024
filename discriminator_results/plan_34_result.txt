The provided example seems to cover a variety of critical aspects needed for a comprehensive travel plan. Here’s a breakdown of how the example addresses the evaluation metrics:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The trip starts and ends in different cities (Provo and Phoenix), fulfilling the requirement of a reasonable progression from the start to the first destination and returns back.
   
2. **Valid Restaurants**: Several restaurants are specified for breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day. This ensures that the food options align with the request for various cuisines.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions in Phoenix are included for the second day, providing a cultural experience. This demonstrates that the plan includes activities for engagement during the stay.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodation is specified and follows the preference for a pet-friendly room, which is critical based on the user’s constraints. The details also meet the requirements regarding maximum occupancy and other house rules.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The use of self-driving for the trip is mentioned, with estimates on duration and cost, which showcases planning for travel.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day provides appropriate information about the current city and reflects whether transportation and dining options are valid. 

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The included data appears to follow through with valid values for transportation, lodging, meals, and attractions that would be expected based on common ecosystems for travelers.

8. **Not Absent**: Provides comprehensive information across days, fulfilling the expected structural elements (transportation, meals, accommodations, attractions) without any absent key information.

9. **Valid Days and Visiting City Number**: The plan covers three days of travel with multiple cities — compliance with these requirements reflects accurate planning.

Considering these factors, the example does an excellent job in fulfilling the commonsense constraints laid out in the evaluation script. It encompasses all necessary details and remains aligned with the user's requests while also showcasing logical flow and coherence for each travel day.

Given the thorough coverage and adherence to the commonsense constraints, I would score the example a **95**. The only thing that prevents a full score is the absence of details about possible conflicts in transportation choices if any arise, though it is generally well-structured.
