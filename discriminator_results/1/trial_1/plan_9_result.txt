The example prompt provides a comprehensive travel plan that addresses various essential constraints. Here's a breakdown of how effectively it covers the commonsense constraints outlined in the evaluation script:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City Sequence**: The travel plan lays out a clear itinerary that includes a departure from Memphis, two Pennsylvania cities (State College and Johnstown), and a return. The sequence is reasonable and follows the logical flow of movement.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day outlines breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. The example ensures that no restaurants are repeated on the same day and provides valid choices for each meal, complying with the restaurant requirements.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The example lists various attractions in each city visited, ensuring that the attractions are relevant to the respective locations, thereby validating its adherence to attraction requirements.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: Each day includes an accommodation entry that validates the minimum stay requirements and matches the city of that day. 

5. **Valid Transportation**: The plan describes transportation for the first and third days. While the plan is reasonable, it could be made stronger by including transportation details for days 2 and 4, where it just states a dash ("-"). This might be interpreted as lacking, as it does not specify how the traveler moves around.

6. **Information in Current City**: Each day provides information that relates to the current location in terms of meals, accommodations, and attractions. However, it could benefit from more specificity regarding meals on transportation days which may leave gaps.

7. **Absence of Necessary Information**: The plan includes highlighted areas for meals and attractions, ensuring it does not exceed the acceptable absence of information.

8. **Consistent with Query Requirements**: The trip adheres closely to the original query, including the budgetary constraints, number of days, and states specified. 

Based on these evaluations, while the example is strong and well-structured, its effectiveness is slightly hampered by the lack of transportation information on days two and four, which could affect both validity and comprehensiveness. However, it is otherwise quite thorough in its other respects.

Overall, this example merits a score of 88 for its detailed structure, coverage of constraints, and strong alignment with the query requirements, but minor gaps in transportation detail prevent it from achieving a perfect score.
