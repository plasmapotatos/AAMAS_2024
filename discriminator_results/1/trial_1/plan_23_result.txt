To evaluate the given travel plan example against the commonsense constraints defined in the evaluation script, let's analyze its components systematically to see if it provides comprehensive coverage of the required checks:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The plan has a clear origin (San Jose) and a valid itinerary moving through two cities (Boise and Idaho Falls) in Idaho, returning to San Jose.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: All meals listed have corresponding restaurants each day, and the cuisines mentioned in the dining options align with the assigned budgets.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Each day lists attractions that are relevant and varied. This indicates proper planning for sight-seeing options.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: There are accommodations listed for each day, and consideration is shown for maximum occupancy and minimum nights rules.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Transportation is clearly stated, with specific modes (Flights, Taxis) and relevant details like costs, ensuring the provided travel details are coherent.

6. **Information in Current City**: For each day, the plan ties breakfast, lunch, dinner, transportation, accommodation, and attractions to the respective current city, confirming adequate planning.

7. **Information in Sandbox**: The travel plan integrates various elements valid in the context, avoiding unrealistic travel times and distances relevant to Idaho.

8. **Not Absent/Overall Completeness**: All days have transportation info, meal options, and accommodation clearly stated, ensuring no crucial details are missing. The plan met the query requirements, including budgetary constraints and dietary preferences.

Based on the above points, the example effectively covers the essential components detailed in the evaluation script, demonstrating logical coherence and adherence to commonsense constraints.

**Score Analysis**: The overall quality of this example is high due to its attention to detail and adherence to the requirements posed by the user. There are minimal drawbacks, such as slight ambiguity in any specific meal or attraction missing on the last travel day. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall completeness.

**Final Score**: Given the comprehensive coverage across all evaluation criteria with minimal flaws, I would assign a score of 95.
