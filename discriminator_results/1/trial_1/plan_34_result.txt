The prompt given has several strengths and weaknesses when evaluated against the commonsense constraints defined in the evaluation script. Here are the deductions:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City:** The travel plan indicates a clear departure from Provo to Phoenix and then a return, which captures the intent to travel in a closed loop. The prompt's first city corresponds with the query's origin, fulfilling this constraint.

2. **Valid Transportation:** The transportation method is explicitly stated as "Self-driving" for two sections of the trip. However, it's missing for the second day, which could create confusion regarding how individuals are moving within the city. The absence of transportation details on other days (like Day 2) might lead to ambiguity about getting around.

3. **Restaurant Selection:** The travel plan includes dining options with valid cuisines as requested in the query. There is a diverse selection, aligning well with the user's request for a range of cuisines, thus satisfying this criterion.

4. **Attractions Validity:** The attractions mentioned for Day 2 seem satisfactory, but none are noted for Day 1 or Day 3. This raises questions regarding whether valid attractions were explored and included, which could detract from the overall experience.

5. **Accommodations:** The accommodations are described in detail, indicating they are private, which matches the userâ€™s preferences. However, on Day 3, when traveling back, no accommodation is mentioned, which might imply an overnight stay is unwarranted, or the final day was treated differently.

6. **Validity of Information in Current City:** The plan's narration does not directly ensure that the groceries or meals correspond to the locations specified effectively. While there is comprehensive information about meals, attractions relevant to the culinary options might still be absent, which represents a potential mismatch.

7. **Overall Information Density:** There are some inconsistencies in details, particularly related to potential missing or unclear information about meals/activities on specific days, and accommodation during the last night.

While the plan does convey much of the required information and respects many of the constraints, they introduce some ambiguities and inconsistencies. Thus, considering the coverage of constraints and potential gaps:

**Score:** While good, it reflects some notable insufficiencies; I'll rate it at 75.
