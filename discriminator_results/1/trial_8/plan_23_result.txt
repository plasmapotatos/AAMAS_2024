To evaluate the prompt and the provided travel plan, we must consider the various aspects involving the commonsense constraints as described in the evaluation script. 

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The travel plan starts at San Jose, which is expected, then travels to Boise and Idaho Falls, both in Idaho, fitting the request to cover two cities. The trip forms a closed loop back to San Jose, which is also necessary.

2. **Valid Restaurants and Cuisine Constraints**: The plan includes diverse restaurant options, meeting both the Indian and French cuisine requirements. Each meal throughout the stay provides different restaurant choices, ensuring that no meal repeats a restaurant within a single day.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions suggested in both Boise and Idaho Falls are diverse and verify the presence of multiple activities for tourists.

4. **Valid Transportation**: The plan indicates the mode of transport accurately. For example, it utilizes a flight from San Jose to Boise, taxis for intercity travel, and ensures that transport modes do not conflict (i.e., no simultaneous mention of self-driving and taxis).

5. **Valid Accommodations**: The accommodations are appropriate for the group size and specify house rules and minimum night requirements. The listing correctly matches the provided details of occupancy and nights needed.

6. **Overall Completeness and Valid Information**: Each day is distinctly outlined with all necessary information present. There are appropriate connections among transportation, cities visited, and attractions/restaurants. 

Each element matches the criteria set forth in the evaluation script; thus, encapsulating various key constraints.

Considering all these aspects:

- The plan successfully meets the required 5-day itinerary.
- The trip's structure adheres to logical travel flow and includes amenities and attractions conducive to intended experiences.
- There are no infractions like repetitions, conflicts in transportation, or unaccommodated dietary constraints.

From an evaluative standpoint, the example provided covers nearly all required metrics, demonstrating clarity and a reasonable travel plan. Given that it satisfies nearly every commonsense requirement of the evaluation script while remaining clear and comprehensive:
