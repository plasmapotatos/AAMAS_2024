To evaluate the provided travel planning example against the commonsense constraint evaluation functions, we need to ensure that it covers a wide range of criteria deemed essential by the evaluation script. Let's analyze the components of the travel plan and their alignment with the requirements detailed in the evaluation functions.

1. **Visiting Cities**: The example starts from Provo, goes to Phoenix, and returns to Provo, indicating a reasonable visiting city sequence and making a closed trip. This satisfies the "is_valid_visiting_city_number" function.

2. **Transportation**: The plan includes a clear transportation method (self-driving) for both the beginning and ending of the trip, but it lacks transport for the second day, which might invoke issues with "is_valid_transportation". Additionally, it mentions the duration, distance, and cost, which provides valid details for evaluation.

3. **Meals**: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided for the first and second days, while only breakfast is included on the third day. Day one has "-" for breakfast and contains a valid meal entry for each subsequent meal. However, the lack of listed meals for day three may contradict the requirement for specifying meals.

4. **Attractions**: Attractions are detailed for Day 2 but not for Day 1 and Day 3. This might lead to issues with "is_valid_attractions".

5. **Accommodation**: The accommodation details are clear, with specifications about costs, pet regulations, and minimum nights required. This satisfies the "is_valid_accommodation."

6. **Cost Calculations**: The total cost is calculated correctly across all days, which aligns well with the expectations of financial coherence in travel plans.

7. **Cuisines**: The prompt specifies a variety of cuisines, and the plan includes these within the meal entries. This fulfills the requirement for variety.

Given that there are shortcomings, such as missing transportation for Day 2, incomplete meal provision on Day 3, and attractions missing on Day 1 and Day 3, the example fails to thoroughly fulfill all the necessary conditions, which lowers its scoring. The crucial aspect that significantly affects the score is the absence of adequate meals on all days and activities, which results in an incomplete travel plan.

Hence, while the example covers many aspects well—such as transportation on certain days, accommodations, and cuisines—there are several flaws that cannot go unnoticed from the commonsense constraints perspective.

Considering all these observations, I would score the example as follows:
