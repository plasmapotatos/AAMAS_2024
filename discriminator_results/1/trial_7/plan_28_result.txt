### Reasoning

The given travel plan example is rich in detail and covers numerous aspects that are evaluated by the evaluation script. Here are the specifics of how the example matches the evaluation criteria:

1. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The plan accurately lays out a sequence where the travelers start at St. Louis, visit multiple cities in California and then return to St. Louis. This aligns well with validation checks for a reasonable city sequence.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Multiple unique restaurants are listed for every day, fitting well within the dining preferences provided in the prompt (e.g., showcasing American and Chinese cuisines).

3. **Valid Attractions**: Various attractions are specified for each day of the stay in California, making sure that each city has its unique points of interest.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodations noted for each day are specific, diverse, and consistently maintained in the description, complying with minimum stay requirements.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The use of flights and taxis is clearly stated, with appropriate details provided (flight numbers, departure and arrival information), ensuring no conflicting transportation modes.

6. **Information in Current City**: Each day's lodging, attractions, and meals align properly with the current city, and there are no mismatches, indicating strong accuracy in location-based information.

7. **Not Absent**: The travel plan is complete with the required details, including transport, meals, accommodations, and attractions. There are no empty values or missing critical information.

8. **Valid Days and Visiting City Count**: The number of days detailed is 7, and the number of unique cities visited aligns perfectly with the constraints described in the query.

In all aspects, the prompt adequately captures all necessary elements leading to a thorough travel itinerary, which suggests the example will likely score well on the commonsense constraint metrics.

### Score

Given the comprehensive detailing and adherence to stipulated requirements, I would rate this example a **95**. It covers all criteria profoundly but could potentially improve by showcasing more variety in local cuisine placements or attractions across each day.
