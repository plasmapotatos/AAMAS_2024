To evaluate whether the given travel planning example meets the commonsense constraint metric, I will analyze its components in relation to the criteria outlined in the evaluation script.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary includes a clear start and end point (San Jose to Boise to Idaho Falls and returning to San Jose), and the cities listed (Boise and Idaho Falls) are valid according to the mapping.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day includes different meal options (breakfast, lunch, dinner) with specific restaurant names, which appear to follow the cuisine preferences stated in the prompt. There are variations in each meal, preventing repetition.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions are listed for each day. For instance, Zoo Boise is appropriately attributed to Boise, and the attractions listed for Idaho Falls are also valid and specific, which aligns with the travel planning.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: Multiple nights in accommodations are clearly indicated with names, specifics about costs, and the minimum nights requirement. 

5. **Valid Transportation**: The types of transportation are mentioned with specifics (e.g., flight number, taxi) and costs are detailed for each leg of the journey. 

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: The itinerary coordinates with city names in transportation, dining, and attraction selections. Each city mentioned matches the context of the city of activity.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The internal checks reference costs with appropriate flight and restaurant information validations. For instance, the flight number provided appears concatenated with cost and times, supporting a structured plan.

8. **Absent Information**: Each day contains the essential information needed (transportation, meals, attractions, accommodation), following the requirement for no element to be absent.

9. **Visiting City Number**: The trip closes the loop with a defined structure and number of cities visited.

10. **Valid Days**: The script would check that each day has valid entries, and indeed a total of 5 days are documented as proposed.

The example effectively addresses all the criteria outlined in the evaluation script. Each component is specific, relevant, and logical in the context of the query. Thus, this serves as a comprehensive example that meets the commonsense constraints while promoting fluency in the layout of a travel itinerary.

Given the thoroughness in covering all required metrics laid out in the evaluation script and the logical flow of the example, I would rate this travel plan very favorably.
