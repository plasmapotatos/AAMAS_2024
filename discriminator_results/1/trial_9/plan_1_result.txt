To evaluate the usefulness of the given travel planning example in relation to the commonsense constraints set forth in the evaluation script, we need to assess whether it covers all aspects of the evaluation criteria comprehensively.

1. **Valid Day Count**: The example specifies that the trip lasts for three days, matching the description in the query. This component is well covered.

2. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The example starts in St. Petersburg, travels to Rockford, and returns, establishing a valid starting and ending city. Each day includes valid information about the current city. This too is adequately addressed.

3. **Transportation Validity**: Day one lists a flight from St. Petersburg to Rockford, along with flight details. Day three includes a return flight. However, day two lacks transportation (listed as "-"), which could raise a flag in terms of expectations for transportation continuity.

4. **Restaurant Validity**: Each day includes dining options, and the meals are distinct per day which satisfies the no-repetition condition. Thus, it meets restaurant constraints well.

5. **Attraction Validity**: The day two attractions appear satisfactory, but day one does not have any listed attractions. In evaluation terms, it could be perceived as a lack of engagement with local attractions, which might fail to fully comply with expectations.

6. **Accommodation Validity**: The accommodation details on the first and second day are well provided, including minimum night stipulations. While day three does not list accommodations (marked as "-"), this is acceptable for a departure day, presuming it conforms to typical travel itineraries.

7. **Validity in Current City**: Each day's listed meal and transportation (where applicable) fits the corresponding current city. The validation metrics appear to be satisfied in this case.

8. **Absentee Information**: While the example attempts to address all necessary components, there is an absence in listings on certain days that could be critiqued for lack of thoroughness in engaging local amenities.

9. **Cuisines**: The response clarifies that since no specific cuisine constraints were given, all related dining choices comply with the implicit expectations.

Considering these factors, while the travel plan covers many of the necessary constraints effectively, it does display shortcomings in providing consistent transportation details and attractions across all three days. Therefore, the optimal score will reflect an acknowledgment of its strengths while also addressing its gaps.

Thus, the final evaluation score for the example is **80**, taking into account both its strengths in structure and planning as well as its inconsistencies.
