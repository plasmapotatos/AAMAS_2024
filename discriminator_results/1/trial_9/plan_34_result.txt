To evaluate the example provided, we need to determine how well it adheres to the requirements delineated in the evaluation script for travel plans. The key aspects we need to review include the logical sequence of cities, accommodation details, transportation methods, meals, and attractions. The example must also be evaluated to ensure it fulfills the commonsense constraints indicated in the evaluation script.

### Reasoning:

1. **Logical Route and Valid Cities**: The example begins in Provo and ends in Phoenix before returning to Provo. The cities mentioned are valid and correctly follow a sequence that allows accommodation with reasonable transportation.

2. **Accommodation Compliance**: The accommodation mentioned must be pet-friendly (per the prompt), which the example provides. It also specifies maximum occupancy and house rules, satisfying the constraints for accommodation checks.

3. **Transportation**: The travel plan specifies self-driving both ways, which is consistent throughout the itinerary. The script requires valid transportation modes, and this has been addressed adequately.

4. **Meals and Restaurants**: Meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided, mostly consistent with the requested cuisines. However, the script evaluates whether each meal's city matches the current city, which is adequately followed.

5. **Attractions**: Day 2 includes identified attractions that align with the current city. Attractions should logically correlate with the city being visited, and this is maintained in the travel plan.

6. **Days and Cost Calculations**: The plan accounts for the total number of days specified in the query, and the costs across all days are calculated systematically, ensuring that they stay under the proposed budget.

7. **Absence Check**: There is a valid representation of required information for each day, with no significant absence of the necessary components such as accommodations, attractions, meals, and transportation.

8. **Cuisines Requested**: The example appropriately covers the diverse cuisines listed in the prompt, ensuring that the dietary preferences indicated are addressed.

Overall, the example travel plan adheres strongly to the evaluation criteria present in the script and presents a comprehensive and cohesive response to the prompt posed.

### Score:
Considering all the aspects listed and their adherence to the required evaluation functions, I assign a score of **95**. This score reflects that it is an exemplary travel plan containing all the necessary details, while a slight decrease is due to some minimal missed opportunities for clarity in sync between meal choices and current cities on Day 1 and 3.
