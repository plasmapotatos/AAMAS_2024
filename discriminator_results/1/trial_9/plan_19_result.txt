To determine the effectiveness of the provided travel plan example as a good illustration for the evaluation script, multiple factors need to be considered. The example should demonstrate comprehensive coverage of all evaluation metrics outlined in the script. To rationalize the scoring, we will analyze how well the example adheres to the following specific metrics:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The plan correctly follows the format of visiting cities, beginning from Washington, moving to Orlando, and returning to Washington.
2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day's meals feature unique restaurant choices, without any repetitions that could violate the constraints.
3. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions listed for day 2 are different, maintaining variety in the travel plan.
4. **Valid Accommodation**: There is a consistent mention of private room accommodations, and the same address is validly reused for its necessary duration.
5. **Valid Transportation**: Transportation methods are correctly stated, particularly self-driving, which aligns with the distances and travel formats used.
6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Meals and accommodations are explicitly stated for days where transportation was either mentioned or non-necessary.
7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The selected restaurants and attractions are likely valid based on their realistic representation, but this would depend on actual data.
8. **Not Absent Information**: The example specifies all necessary meal and accommodation details for the planned travel days.
   
Now, on assessing the coherence and completeness of the travel plan:

- **Completeness**: The plan provides structured information across three days. Each entry contains substantial information pertinent to restaurants, transportation, attractions, and costs.
- **Consistency**: The cities visited and the transportation methods are consistent. The trip begins and ends at the correct locations per the itinerary.
- **Practicality**: The details in costs, transportation durations, and accommodation specifics are practical and relatable for real travel scenarios.

With all these considerations, the strengths of this example in providing a well-rounded travel experience are evident. However, it could perhaps achieve greater depth in terms of listing different attractions for each day rather than repeating some attributes in less detail.

Given this analysis, I would score this example as follows:
