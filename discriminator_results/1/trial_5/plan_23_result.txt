The evaluation of the provided example suggests it is a reasonably comprehensive representation of the query-based travel itinerary planning mechanism. Here’s the reasoning for the score:

1. **Valid City Sequence**: The itinerary effectively illustrates a valid city sequence with appropriate transportation modes, making it clear where the trip begins and ends.
2. **Reasonable Visiting Cities**: The cities selected align well with the query specifications. The travel plan respects the query's requirement to cover two cities in Idaho and initiates from San Jose.
3. **Accommodation Details**: There’s clarity regarding accommodation specifics, including costs, maximum occupancy, and minimum nights, which is crucial for the evaluation.
4. **Dining Options**: The meals listed correspond to the cuisines specified in the query (Indian and French), indicating adherence to dietary requests.
5. **Attractions**: Each day includes a mix of attractions that are valid within their respective locations, showing a good representation of local options.
6. **Transportation**: The transportation methods are detailed with sufficient information (like flight and taxi details), enhancing transparency about travel logistics.
7. **Cost Assessment**: Total costs provided reflect calculations that consider the number of people and meal costs, adding reliability to the financial aspect of the trip.

However, the plan lacks explicit confirmation of valid restaurants and attractions per day in a more structured manner; there's just a list of meals and attractions with no repeated checks or assessments of their validity against external databases. Also, there's a small inconsistency in the returning trip's lack of meals, which could have further expanded the travel itinerary's completeness.

Given these aspects, while the example is strong, it also presents areas to improve on regarding the completeness of certain validations and clarity around meal provisions on the return trip.

Considering all factors, I assign the score:

<output>90</output>
