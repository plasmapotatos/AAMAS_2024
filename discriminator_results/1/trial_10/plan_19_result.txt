### Reasoning:

To evaluate the given example, we need to assess how well it fulfills the requirements laid out in the evaluation script. 

1. **Coverage of Required Information**:
   - The travel plan includes crucial elements like `Transportation`, `Breakfast`, `Lunch`, `Dinner`, `Attraction`, and `Accommodation` for all three days, along with `Current City` information. This satisfies the need for comprehensive travel details.
   - The plan indicates the use of transportation (self-driving), which is matched with specific routes, fulfilling the transportation validity checks.
   - The meals are provided for each day, ensuring that the required meal data is present and adhering to the constraints.

2. **Reasonable City Visits**:
   - The travel plan demonstrates a logical flow between cities, with a proper departure and return loop (from Washington to Orlando and back), complying with the city's sequence constraints.
   - The evaluation script requires the trip to be a closed circle which this plan successfully achieves.

3. **Validation of Dining and Attractions**:
   - Each day's travel plan includes valid restaurants and attractions. However, certain meals are marked as "-", which may need to be evaluated based on the requirement for every meal, though some flexibility is noted in case of preferences or dietary restrictions.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The total costs have been accurately computed for all days, adhering to the budget constraints outlined in the query.
   - The clear separation of cost for different components allows for easy validation against the expected budget.

5. **Transport and Activity Logic**:
   - It utilizes specific forms of transportation over multiple days and ensures that restaurants and activities reasonably correlate with the cities visited.

6. **Absence of Required Information**:
   - The plan adequately avoids missing any of the important elements by including "Transportation", "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Attraction", and "Accommodation", thereby minimizing the amount of absent information.

Overall, while there are a few meals labeled as "-", they are generally in the context of preference and do not appear critical to rejection by the various validation criteria. The example is very illustrative, covers various required checks, and provides logical and coherent travel information. Therefore, it successfully meets the commonsense constraints expected in travel planning.

### Score:
Given the thorough fulfillment of requirements, validity of details, and logical consistency, I would assign a score of **90**. Thereâ€™s minor room for improvement regarding meal details but overall, this is a robust example.
