Reasoning:
The provided example does a commendable job of covering multiple evaluation functions outlined in the evaluation script. Below are the specific aspects addressed, demonstrating its effectiveness:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City** - The flow from Provo to Phoenix and back to Provo provides a clear starting point, route and closure for the journey, establishing a valid sequence of cities.

2. **Valid Restaurants** - The example includes restaurant choices for each day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) with specific names, costs, and the cuisines listed, which demonstrate valid selections.

3. **Valid Attractions** - The attractions listed for Day 2 are specific and separate, avoiding repetitions and conflicts with the daily plans.

4. **Valid Accommodation** - The accommodation's details, including house rules and minimum stay requirements, align with business practices for such bookings, ensuring compliance with standards.

5. **Valid Transportation** - The example specifies the modes of transportation along with their costs, showing a well-considered travel plan that avoids conflicting transportation methods.

6. **Valid Information in Current City** - Each day provides relevant meals and attractions that are specifically stated to be in the current city. 

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox** - The plan's use of realistic data such as distance, duration, and cost fairly reflects expected outcomes and adheres to completeness.

8. **Accommodation Rules Consideration** - Noting the preference for pet-friendly accommodations aligns with travelers' needs as reflected in the query.

However, there are some aspects that could improve:
- The breakfast on Day 1 is unspecified, which may be a minor point but indicates a lack of completeness.
- Day 3 only has a breakfast option and lacks a lunch/dinner plan or accommodation details.

Overall, the example captures the majority of the essential aspects to be evaluated by the script but could use some enhancement in details especially for certain days. The complexity and coverage support a higher score.

Score: 85
