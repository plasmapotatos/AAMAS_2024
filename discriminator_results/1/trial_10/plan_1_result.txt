To evaluate the effectiveness of the provided example in covering the commonsense constraints outlined in the evaluation script, let's analyze the various constraints it addresses:

1. **Is Reasonable Visiting City**: The example clearly states a route from St. Petersburg to Rockford and back, which conforms to the requirement of having a closed trip circle.
  
2. **Is Valid Restaurants**: The meal options included (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) are well-defined, and no restaurant is repeated across different days, satisfying this constraint.

3. **Is Valid Attractions**: Attractions are listed for each day, and there are multiple attractions without repetitions on the same day.

4. **Is Valid Accommodation**: The accommodation section includes details and is repeated for the relevant days, maintaining consistency.

5. **Is Valid Transportation**: Transportation includes specific flight details for the outbound and inbound trips which are relevant and connected to the stated cities.

6. **Is Valid Information in Current City**: The plan includes transportation information correlating to the listed current cities, adhering to the location constraints.

7. **Is Valid Information in Sandbox**: The flights mentioned are presumably valid, but the data validation might be better with checks in a live environment. However, the self-contained information seems reasonable.

8. **Is Not Absent**: The plan meets the required fields for transportation, accommodation, meals, and attractions across the days planned.

9. **Is Valid Visiting City Number**: The cities mentioned adhere to the expected number of visiting cities, as there are only two principal destinations.

10. **Is Valid Days**: Each day corresponds to entries in the travel plan, thereby fulfilling the expected number of days.

The provided example successfully adheres to the various constraints outlined in the evaluation script, covering the necessary details, presenting a logical travel itinerary and confirming the constraints are well-met. 

Given its comprehensive nature and adherence to multiple constraints, this example would likely score very high. However, it could be slightly improved with more specific details regarding the attractions or accommodations' validation to ensure clarity.

Taking these points into account, I would rate the example a score of 95, recognizing both its strengths and minor areas that could benefit from further elaboration.
