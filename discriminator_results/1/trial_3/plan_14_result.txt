To evaluate the example, we must analyze if it comprehensively addresses the evaluation functions in the provided evaluation script.

1. **is_reasonable_visiting_city**: The travel plan starts in Daytona Beach and visits multiple cities, aligning with the requirement for a reasonable visit structure. 
   
2. **is_valid_restaurants**: Each day has restaurant entries (breakfast, lunch, dinner), and they are distinct and valid, providing a rich variety of cuisine options.

3. **is_valid_attractions**: Attractions are listed for each applicable day, staying consistent with the city they are associated with, fulfilling the requirement for valid attractions.

4. **is_valid_accommodation**: Each day includes accommodation details, and the accommodation matches the city for that day, demonstrating adherence to the accommodation rules.

5. **is_valid_transportation**: The transportation method is specified for most travel days, particularly during transitions between cities. It employs self-driving, which is also consistent with the participant's travel method for the trip.

6. **is_valid_information_in_current_city**: Each day's plan includes relevant information for the current city, ensuring that meals and attractions correspond to the city that the traveler is in.

7. **is_valid_information_in_sandbox**: The travel entries for transportation, cuisine, and accommodation provide information that would reasonably correspond to the corresponding cities, supporting validity in the sandbox checks.

8. **is_not_absent**: The example successfully avoids any significant gaps in required information across the required parameters, staying compliant with the expected format and providing necessary details.

Evaluating the provided travel plan against the constraints laid out in the script shows that it addresses each component effectively, presenting detailed and relevant information throughout. The completeness of data, cohesion of travel itineraries, and adherence to constraints indicate that this example fulfills its purpose admirably.

Given these considerations, I would score this example as a 95, as it covers all key areas required in the constraint evaluation and demonstrates strong coherence and completeness.
