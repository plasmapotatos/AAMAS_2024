To evaluate the travel planning agent's effectiveness based on the provided example, we need to ensure that the example is comprehensive and detailed enough to cover the various aspects assessed by the evaluation functions. 

1. **Reasonable City Visits**: The plan includes a clear starting point (Washington) and a distinct end point (Orlando), creating a logical circular path, fulfilling the requirement of visiting cities reasonably. Days 1 and 3 demonstrate this with specified destinations.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The daily meals include specific restaurant choices for each meal. Each is adequately diverse and does not repeat any establishments. These details are critical for the `is_valid_restaurants` check.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Attractions for Day 2 are specified clearly, while Days 1 and 3 do not have attractions, which is acceptable since not every day needs attractions.

4. **Accommodation Rules**: The accommodation details are consistent across days with information about minimum nights, occupancy limits, and house rules.

5. **Transportation Validity**: Both self-driving trips are mentioned with travel details, including duration and cost. This ensures that transportation requirements are met.

6. **City Sequence Validity**: The sequence from Washington to Orlando, returning back to Washington, is valid under the constraints of the trip.

7. **No Absent Information**: The plan includes information for all critical components (transportation, meals, attractions, and accommodations) for each day.

8. **Cost Allocation**: The total costs are calculated and broken down transparently, indicating good financial management within the tripâ€™s budget.

Despite these strengths, a few improvements can be made. Day 1 and Day 3 lack specific attractions and other data like breakfast, increasing the risk of potential absent information in propositions.

Considering all the aspects:

- The example provided is detailed and covers essential evaluation metrics.
- It successfully meets commonsense constraints but could be slightly more informative in areas lacking details (such as meals on Day 1 and attractions on Day 3).

Thus, I would rate this example as a quality representation for the evaluation, but not perfect due to minor deficiencies in comprehensiveness.
