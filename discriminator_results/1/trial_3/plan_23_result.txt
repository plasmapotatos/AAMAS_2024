The provided example includes a comprehensive and detailed travel itinerary that effectively demonstrates the required aspects for evaluation. Here’s a breakdown of how it meets the evaluation criteria of the commonsense constraint metric:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary visits two cities in Idaho as specified, with the first day set to start in San Jose and end in Boise, satisfying the query's origin and destination correctly.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day's meals are meticulously planned out with named restaurants that cater to the specified cuisines (Indian and French) which were mentioned in the prompt.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Each day includes attractions in the respective cities, and they are distinctly listed without repetition, which shows attention to detail in planning.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodations specified have been described with clear limitations such as maximum occupancy and house rules. The minimum night requirements are also properly noted.

5. **Valid Transportation**: Both transportation methods (flight and taxi) are valid, appropriately costing, and include necessary details such as departure and arrival times.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: The itinerary provides valid meals, attractions, and accommodations that align with the current city for each day, confirming coherence in planning.

7. **Information in Sandbox**: The transportation methods and names of restaurants and attractions are validated, making sure they meet applicable standards, demonstrated by the calculated costs for the entire trip.

8. **Not Absent**: The itinerary provides a full range of information—transportation, meals, attractions, and accommodation—across all five days, ensuring no aspect of the trip planning is absent.

9. **Valid Days**: The total days planned exactly corresponds to the number requested (5 days), adhering strictly to the criteria laid out in the query.

Overall, the example is rich with details, covers all necessary aspects of planning, and aligns with the evaluation criteria outlined in the script.

Given these points, I would assign a score of 95 for this example because it covers all major criteria with minor potential areas for improvement, such as perhaps indicating more explicitly how arrangements could adapt to changes or other practicalities of travel. However, it is largely comprehensive and informative.
