To determine how well the provided example serves the purpose of covering the commonsense constraints as outlined by the evaluation script, we need to carefully evaluate the following components:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The travel plan begins in Washington, moves to Orlando, and returns to Washington, fulfilling the requirement for a closed trip. The cities are valid entries according to the city-state map.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day features breakfast, lunch, and dinner listings. The meal choices are diverse, with no repetitions in restaurants across the three days. There is a valid restaurant listed for each meal, and specific costs are provided.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The plan includes attractions on days two and three. Day one does not have attractions, and day two has multiple attractions specified, which seem valid and are relevant to Orlando.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodations are detailed, including the type (private room), location, cost, and rules. The minimum night rule for accommodation is also observed across the plan.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The transportation choices specify self-driving for the main legs of the trip, which is appropriate given the itinerary. The distance and duration of trips are provided, which add to the validation of transportation details.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: The details provided concerning meals, transportation, attractions, and accommodation accurately correspond to the city listed for each day of travel, meeting the constraints for valid information.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The information is consistent with what standard datasets would allow, stating specific restaurants and attractions in Orlando and providing realistic pricing.

8. **Not Absent**: The plan includes the necessary components (meals, accommodations, transportation, attractions), and no day is left without information.

Overall, the example fully meets the evaluation criteria and would likely score highly due to its thoroughness in addressing all relevant constraints and providing a comprehensive travel plan. 

Taking all of this into consideration, I would assign a score of 95. The travel plan is detailed and adheres closely to commonsense constraints, though minor improvements could be made in diversifying the attractions further to optimize the overall experience provided.
