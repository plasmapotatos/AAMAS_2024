To evaluate the example prompt, I will analyze how well it covers the various commonsense constraints outlined in the evaluation script. This includes checking for aspects like valid city sequences, valid transportation methods, restaurant choices, attractions, accommodations, and overall logical consistency within the travel plan.

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The itinerary includes a clear round trip starting from San Jose to Boise, then to Idaho Falls and back. The cities selected fit the query's requirement for two cities in Idaho.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day includes specific restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with no repetitions of restaurant choices. Each entry looks sufficiently diverse, providing options from various cuisines that align with the query.

3. **Valid Attractions**: The attractions listed for each day in both cities are diverse and contextually appropriate, fulfilling the requirements of providing interest in the locations visited.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The accommodation provided meets the requirement of maximum occupancy and minimum nights specified, ensuring travelers need to book accommodations appropriately.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The itinerary outlines different transport methods, including flights and taxis, and specifies the transportation cost, which is logically sound alongside the duration. It also avoids any conflicting transportation methods within days and adheres to structure.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: Each day's information pertains to the current city, validating transport, meals, and attractions effectively.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The example maintains consistency regarding accommodations and meal choices without presenting errors, such as missing hotels or invalid transport links.

8. **Not Absent Constraint**: There are no missing components, as each day lists meals, transportation, attractions, and accommodation, aligning with the total number of operational days requested.

Overall, the example fully satisfies all evaluation constraints and provides a coherent, logical travel plan that reflects commonsense reasoning. The diversity in cuisine reflects adaptability to travelers' preferences, and the plan stays aligned with the days and cities specified. Some subtle improvements could be made regarding more unique restaurant and attraction options to further diversify experiences. 

Given all these evaluations, I would assign a score of 95, which reflects that this is an excellent example but may not reach a perfect score due to potential for even more precise variation in dining and attractions for full itinerary richness.
