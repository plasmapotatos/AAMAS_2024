To evaluate the provided travel planning example and its effectiveness in maximizing the commonsense constraint metric, we need to consider how comprehensively it addresses all evaluation functions noted in the script. 

### Reasoning:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City Validation**: The itinerary successfully maintains a closed circular trip, starting and ending in San Jose, as required.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: The plan includes diverse dining options, aligning with the specified cuisine preferences (Indian and French). The example notes whether specific meals are included, maintaining a detailed record (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

3. **Valid Attractions**: The travel plan showcases attractions for every day, allowing for varied experiences (e.g., Zoo Boise, Camels Back Park, Giant Eagle Waterfall Nest). Each attraction is specific to its corresponding city.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: Each day lists accommodations that meet the minimum night requirements as outlined (e.g., Duplex in Boise and Perfect Williamsburg Summer Haven in Idaho Falls). 

5. **Valid Transportation**: The transport between cities is clearly detailed (e.g., flights and taxi rides), ensuring transportation is aligned with provided travel plans.

6. **Information in Current City**: The example provides valid city details in correspondence to meals and attractions, confirming that the transportation method corresponds to the cities being visited on that day.

7. **Absence of Information**: The plan appears to avoid absence of critical information since it covers transport, meals, attractions, and lodging across the specified days.

Given that each aspect of the evaluation script is addressed directly within this example, and the plan adheres to commonsense constraints while being sufficiently detailed, the overall quality of the prompt and the generated itinerary is high.

### Score:
Based on the evaluations across all categories and considering the logical coherence and completeness of information presented:
