To evaluate the provided example against the commonsense constraints defined in the evaluation script, let's analyze various aspects of the travel plan, ensuring it meets the necessary criteria, as well as identifying any potential shortcomings.

### Reasoning

1. **Travel Details**: 
   - The trip starts in St. Petersburg and ends in Rockford, which is valid as it represents a common travel pattern. It creates a closed loop (St. Petersburg → Rockford → St. Petersburg), which is required by the evaluation script.
  
2. **Days and Current City**: 
   - The plan is for three consecutive days which matches the requested duration. The `current_city` entries on each day are logically sequenced, providing a reasonable flow.
  
3. **Transportation**: 
   - Flights are appropriately used for the journeys with valid flight numbers and times provided. For day 1 and day 3, the transport mode corresponds to the cities mentioned, which is valid per the evaluation rules.
   - However, the transport mode for day 2 is omitted, which could lead to a failure in constraints; each day is expected to have some form of transportation if relevant.

4. **Restaurants**: 
   - Each day includes valid meals with distinct restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There's sufficient variation in the restaurant names across the itinerary, preventing repetition.

5. **Attractions**: 
   - Day 2 and Day 3 include valid attractions, and these do not repeat, complying with the evaluation function for attractions.

6. **Accommodation**: 
   - Accommodation entries meet the requirement of being maintained or repeated as necessary (staying in Rockford for two nights), and adheres to the stated minimum as well.

7. **Cuisines and Cost**: 
   - There is no conflict with cuisine preferences since it is stated that cuisines are not specified. Costs are detailed and sensible given the budget constraint.

8. **Total Validity of Information**: 
   - The overall structure meets multiple validation checks, though the omission of transportation on Day 2 might lead to a potential failure in the 'is_not_absent' checks.

### Final Evaluation
The example is strong overall, clearly outlining a detailed travel itinerary that is mostly compliant with the constraints set by the evaluation script. However, the absence of transportation on Day 2 could result in failing critical evaluation checks. 

Taking all these aspects into account, I would give a score of **85**. This reflects a well-structured and detailed example, hindered slightly by the critical omission on the second day.
