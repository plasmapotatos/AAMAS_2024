### Reasoning:

To evaluate the effectiveness of the provided travel planning example, we need to assess if it could adequately cover all the evaluation criteria defined in the evaluation script. Let's break down the example against the various constraints:

1. **Reasonable Visiting City**: The travel plan starts from Daytona Beach and visits Corpus Christi, San Antonio, and Dallas. Each city is distinct and meets the user's request of visiting three cities in Texas over 7 days.

2. **Valid Restaurants**: Each day includes specified restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and no restaurant is repeated across the days, which addresses the evaluation function correctly.

3. **Valid Attractions**: Each day lists attractions for the cities being visited, ensuring they are not repeated and are well-suited to their respective cities.

4. **Valid Accommodation**: The plan provides accommodations that include details on the costs and restrictions (e.g., minimum nights), which are essential for judging the accommodation's validity.

5. **Valid Transportation**: The plan designates transportation for travel between cities (self-driving), with duration and cost detailed, adhering to the constraints set by the evaluation script.

6. **Valid Information in Current City**: The plan includes accurate transportation choices corresponding to the current city for each day. Each meal and attraction is relevant to the city being visited, fulfilling this criterion.

7. **Valid Information in Sandbox**: The information regarding flight and road conditions is absent but is permissible since this is a road trip. The validations for cost and details in the transportation methods are correctly shown.

8. **Not Absent**: Daily entries include crucial details like transportation, meals, attractions, and accommodations, covering more than 50% of the required data points.

9. **Valid Days and Visiting City Number**: The plan goes through 7 days and visits the number of cities as specified in the query. 

In summary, the travel example seems comprehensive as it fulfills the requirements laid out in the evaluation functions. Each component of the travel plan contributes to validating the constraints and provides essential information that can be evaluated.

### Score:
Considering that the example successfully addresses all evaluation criteria with attention to specific details, it deserves a high score.
